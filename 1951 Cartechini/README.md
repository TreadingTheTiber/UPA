## Caput 11: Quid Sit Theologice Certum

[...] 

**Dogmatic facts are those which as elements of fact enter into some proposition which no one can deny either as a matter of faith or as theologically certain: that the Church is infallible in dogmatic fact is at least theologically certain.**

All these are enumerated:

i) the **fact of the legitimacy of some Pope or of some council, such as Trent** (it enters as an element of fact in all the dogmas of the Council of Trent).

ii) the **meaning of some proposition or of some book in relation to the faith** (cf. Jansenius).

iii) the **heretical character of some person** (Nestorius, Wyclif): it may be necessary to define this lest the faithful be infected by their doctrine.

iv) the **orthodoxy of some Father of the Church or of some book of his.**

v) the **sanctity of some person** (in canonization).

vi) the **nullity or reality of such an ordination**, for example, that of the Anglicans.

vii) the **value of the sanctification of such a religious order**.

viii) the **authenticity of the Vulgate.**

ix) the **fact of such an obligation which arises from such an ecclesiastical law**, for example, of confessing oneself once a year, or of communicating at Easter.

x) the **existence of sacramentals.**

xi) the **existence of such impediments in matrimony.**

**It matters little if we cannot resolve the question whether certain of these facts are dogmas or only theologically certain**: for on the one hand these particular things seem to be revealed—**this being is created, this man is redeemed, the Council of Trent is infallible, this Pope is infallible**—because in these cases there is no addition to Revelation but an explication or application of it. On the other hand, however, **many things are revealed by God in general, so that they are to be believed only in general**: for **I am not bound to make an act of faith that this child is born in original sin, or that this Pope is infallible; but I am bound to make or elicit an act of faith concerning those things which he himself defines.**
