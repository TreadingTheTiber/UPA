| ## CAPUT 11: QUID SIT THEOLOGICE CERTUM | | ## CHAPTER 11: WHAT IS THEOLOGICALLY CERTAIN |
| ### I. DEFINITUR QUID SIT THEOLOGICE CERTUM ET CRITERIA AD IPSUM DIGNOSCENDUM. | | ### I. WHAT IS THEOLOGICALLY CERTAIN IS DEFINED AND THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING IT. |
| Duo elementa definiunt quænam sit propositio theologice certa: unum positivum, aliud negativum. | | Two elements define what proposition is theologically certain: one positive, the other negative. |
| Positivum est certitudo veritatis ipsius propositionis theologice certæ, quæ certitudo habetur ex universalitate consensus ut in propositionem theologice certam, vel saltem ex intimo nexu cum doctrina fidei. Negativum est quod ista propositio non proponitur et prædicatur ut certo revelata ac de fide. Ratio vero cur non censeatur esse simpliciter de fide, licet universaliter teneatur ut certa, potest esse duplex: vel quia non constat sufficienter quod consensus sit in eam non solum ut in propositionem veram sed etiam ut in propositionem revelatam et de fide credendam, atque ideo antequam de illa definitio Ecclesiæ existat, theologi generatim fateantur non posse dici simpliciter de fide; vel quia est **conclusio theologica** deducta ex una quidem propositione revelata, ex alia vero certa aliunde, scilicet vel theologice vel lumine rationis. | | The positive aspect is the certitude of the truth of the theological proposition itself that is theologically certain, which certitude is had either from the universality of consensus regarding it as a theologically certain proposition, or at least from an intimate connection with the doctrine of faith. The negative aspect is that this proposition is not proposed and proclaimed as certainly revealed and of the faith. The reason, moreover, why it is not considered to be simply of the faith, although it is universally held as certain, can be twofold: either because it is not sufficiently established that the consensus regarding it is not only as regarding a true proposition but also as regarding a revealed proposition to be believed as of the faith, and therefore before a definition of the Church exists concerning it, theologians generally acknowledge that it cannot be called simply of the faith; or because it is a **theological conclusion** deduced from one proposition that is indeed revealed, but from another that is certain from elsewhere, namely either theologically or by the light of reason. |
| **1. *Theologice certa* est quæ admittitur ab omnibus scholis ut intime connexa cum Revelatione.** | | **1. *Theologically certain* is that which is admitted by all schools as intimately connected with Revelation.** |
| *Est conclusio theologica (non dico scholastica).* Ex hac propositione patet quod omnes theses *systematicæ* seu propriæ alicuius systematis non sunt theologicæ certæ; seu theses de quibus admittitur disputatio inter catholicos non sunt theologicæ certæ. Ita: de uno esse in Christo; quod non detur reprobatio negativa; et de medio cognitionis futuribilium ex parte Dei; quomodo sit quantitas et statura naturalis in Christo in Eucharistia; quomodo sit explicandus influxus Dei in hominem inspiratum. | | *It is a theological conclusion (I do not say scholastic).* From this proposition it is evident that all *systematic* theses or those proper to some particular system are not theologically certain; or theses concerning which disputation is admitted among Catholics are not theologically certain. Thus: that there is one being in Christ; that negative reprobation does not exist; and concerning the medium of knowledge of futuribles on the part of God; how quantity and natural stature exist in Christ in the Eucharist; how the influence of God upon an inspired man is to be explained. |
| Quando ergo in aliqua thesi habetur ut *adversarius aliquis theologus catholicus* qui non sit evidenter damnatus ab aliquo documento officiali, vel cuius doctrina non sit evidenter inconciliabilis cum doctrina alicuius concilii vel Pontificis posterioris illi theologo, vel cuius sententia non sit evidenter derelicta ab omnibus posterioribus theologis, ut sæpe evenit v.g. | | Therefore, when in any given thesis there is found as *an adversary some Catholic theologian* who has not been evidently condemned by any official document, or whose doctrine is not evidently irreconcilable with the doctrine of any council or Pontiff posterior to that theologian, or whose opinion has not been evidently abandoned by all subsequent theologians, as frequently happens, for example, |
| *Durando et Occam aut Biel: signum est quod thesis dici non potest theologice certa.* | | *with Durandus and Ockham or Biel: it is a sign that the thesis cannot be called theologically certain.* |
| **2. Intime connexa cum Revelatione, seu virtualiter revelata, seu theologice certa est illa quæ deducitur ex una certo revelata et ex alia certa, licet non revelata.** | | **2. Intimately connected with Revelation, or virtually revealed, or theologically certain is that which is deduced from one proposition certainly revealed and from another certain, though not revealed.** |
| Potest esse certa ex quocumque campo, sive philosophico, sive theologico, sive historico. Quod requiritur prævia certitudo facti Revelationis est theologice certum: ex eo quod actus fidei est *(dogma)* rationabilis et irrevocabilis; quod ad cognoscenda miracula non requiritur per se lumen supernaturale, quia definitum est miracula esse signa certissima facti Revelationis: quod non esset verum si subiective convincere non possent *intellectum* sine illo lumine; quod inspiratio dicat illustrationem intellectus, motionem voluntatis et assistentiam: quia definita est *natura inspirationis* (Dz. 1787): Deus est auctor Scripturæ universæ; quod exsistentia Dei demonstrari potest; quod naturalis Dei cognitio in hac vita est *solum mediata*: quia in Concilio Viennensi damnatum est quod visio beatifica sit naturalis: sed perceptio immediata Ontologistarum videtur esse idem ac visio beatifica; quod cognoscimus Deum per formam propriam: nam naturalis cognitio non est nisi mediata, ut patet contra Ontologistas (hoc deducitur ex una revelata et alia theologice certa): ergo non est per formam propriam. | | [Certainty] can be certain from any field whatsoever, whether philosophical, theological, or historical. That prior certitude of the fact of Revelation is required is theologically certain: from the fact that the act of faith is *(dogma)* reasonable and irrevocable; that supernatural light is not required per se for knowing miracles, because it has been defined that miracles are the most certain signs of the fact of Revelation: which would not be true if subjectively they could not convince the *intellect* without that light; that inspiration implies illumination of the intellect, motion of the will, and assistance: because the *nature of inspiration* has been defined (Dz. 1787): God is the author of all Scripture; that the existence of God can be demonstrated; that natural knowledge of God in this life is *only mediate*: because in the Council of Vienne it was condemned that the beatific vision is natural: but the immediate perception of the Ontologists seems to be the same as the beatific vision; that we know God through a proper form: for natural knowledge is only mediate, as is evident against the Ontologists (this is deduced from one revealed [truth] and another theologically certain): therefore it is not through a proper form. |
| **3. Non est conclusio theologica, neque est ideo theologice certa illa quæ solum probabiliter et non evidenter deducitur ex principiis revelatis.** | | **3. That which is only probably and not evidently deduced from revealed principles is not a theological conclusion, nor is it therefore theologically certain.** |
| Exemplum: quod visio Dei sit *absolute* supernaturalis est communis doctrina. | | Example: that the vision of God is *absolutely* supernatural is common doctrine. |
| **4. Sunt theologice certæ propositiones in quibus omnes scholæ conveniunt ut in propositiones certas, sed non conveniunt ut in propositiones revelatas et de fide credendas.** | | **4. Those propositions in which all schools agree as certain propositions are theologically certain, but they do not agree [on them] as revealed propositions to be believed by faith.** |
| Signum quod sint theologice certæ est consensus ille qui non posset adesse si res non sit intime connexa cum revelatis: nam in aliis rebus, puta in thesibus quibusdam philosophicis, videmus adesse in scholis multas discrepantias. Ita intelligis hanc notam quæ aliquando datur: est theologice certum ex *consensu* theologorum quod anima Christi habuerit gratiam habitualem et visionem beatificam. | | The sign that they are theologically certain is that consensus which could not be present unless the matter were intimately connected with revealed truths: for in other matters—for instance, in certain philosophical theses—we see that many disagreements are present in the schools. Thus you understand this note which is sometimes given: it is theologically certain from the *consensus* of theologians that the soul of Christ possessed habitual grace and the beatific vision. |
| Dogmata hic sunt pro visione beatifica *unio hypostatica*, pro gratia habituali quod Christus est causa meritoria nostræ iustificationis. | | The dogmas here are, for the beatific vision, the *hypostatic union*; for habitual grace, that Christ is the meritorious cause of our justification. |
| **5. Ut intelligas quæ sit propositio theologice certa, scias esse contradictoriam illarum quæ dicuntur erroneæ.** | | **5. That you may understand what a theologically certain proposition is, know that it is the contradictory of those which are called erroneous.** |
| a)\ Est erronea illa quæ opponitur alicui propositioni quæ, cum sit certa, tamen non est certum esse de fide; | | a)\ That is erroneous which is opposed to some proposition which, although it is certain, nevertheless is not certain to be of the faith; |
| b)\ vel quando oppositio, licet contradictoria sit certe de fide, non sit omnino certa et indubitata. Aliis verbis hic disputatio esset de ipsa oppositione (de ontologismo cf. P. Lennerz, *de Deo uno*, pag. 65: requiritur ratiocinium ad ostendendam illam oppositionem); | | b)\ or when the opposition, although it is contradictory to what is certainly of the faith, is not entirely certain and beyond doubt. In other words, here there would be a dispute about the opposition itself (concerning ontologism cf. P[ater] Lennerz, *de Deo uno*, p. 65: reasoning is required to demonstrate that opposition); |
| c)\ quæ negat immediate propositionem quæ non est de fide, sed conclusio theologica deducta evidenter ex una de fide et altera evidenti solum lumine naturæ. v.g. soli Episcopi sunt successores Apostolorum. | | c)\ which denies immediately a proposition that is not of the faith, but is a theological conclusion evidently deduced from one premise that is of the faith and another evident by the light of nature alone. e.g., only Bishops are the successors of the Apostles. |
| Hic verificatur notio erroris supra explicata. Qui enim negat conclusionem theologice certam non est hæreticus, quia non negat aliquid formaliter revelatum, nisi neget etiam præmissam de fide ex qua infertur; errat tamen gravissime, quia negat id ex quo negato convinci potest, adhibito alio principio naturali evidenti, ad negandum obiectum fidei (*exemplum*: de infallibilitate in conclusionibus theologicis et in factis dogmaticis). Qui enim negat conclusionem theologicam deductam evidenter ex præmissa certa de fide et ex alia præmissa evidenti ex lumine naturæ, eo ipso deducitur necessario ad negandam præmissam de fide, quantum est ex parte obiecti negati, quia præmissa evidens naturaliter necessitat ad eam non negandam; constat autem ex logica quod non potest conclusio esse falsa nisi una ex præmissis sit falsa, quia falsum non procedit a vero sed solum a falso, licet verum posset deduci a falso. Cum ergo etiam illatio sit evidens et negari non possit, est necesse quod neget præmissam de fide, quæ sola potest libere negari, quia alia est naturaliter evidens. | | Here the notion of error explained above is verified. For he who denies a theologically certain conclusion is not a heretic, because he does not deny something formally revealed, unless he also denies the premise of faith from which it is inferred; nevertheless, he errs most gravely, because he denies that from whose denial it can be proved, by applying another evident natural principle, that he must deny an object of faith (*example*: concerning infallibility in theological conclusions and in dogmatic facts). For he who denies a theological conclusion evidently deduced from a certain premise of faith and from another premise evident by the light of nature, is thereby necessarily led to denying the premise of faith, insofar as concerns the object denied, because the naturally evident premise necessitates him not to deny it; moreover, it is established from logic that a conclusion cannot be false unless one of the premises is false, because the false does not proceed from the true but only from the false, although the true could be deduced from the false. Therefore, since the inference is also evident and cannot be denied, it is necessary that he deny the premise of faith, which alone can be freely denied, because the other is naturally evident. |
| **6. Quare signum certum et facile ad cognoscendam aliquam propositionem theologice certam est considerare an ex negatione eius sequatur negatio alicuius dogmatis.** | | **6. Therefore, a certain and easy sign for recognizing some theologically certain proposition is to consider whether from its denial there follows the denial of some dogma.** |
| Cf.\ thesis de virtualiter revelatis et de factis dogmaticis; de singulis partibus quæ sunt inspiratæ. | | Cf.\ thesis concerning things virtually revealed and concerning dogmatic facts; concerning the individual parts which are inspired. |
| **7. Sæpe nostræ theses, quamvis sint desumptæ ex conciliis, tamen non sunt dogmata sed solum theologice certæ, quia continent aliquam determinationem quæ non est in concilio et quæ tamen ex concilio deducitur.** | | **7. Our theses are often, although they are drawn from councils, nevertheless not dogmas but only theologically certain, because they contain some determination which is not in the council and which nevertheless is deduced from the council.** |
| Concilia enim solent habere hanc regulam: eligunt in definiendo aliquam formulam satis genericam quæ possit explicari secundum varia systemata theologica; quia concilium vult, ut ita dicam, respectare seu salvare omnia systemata, si non sint evidenter falsa. Quare definiunt minimum quod sufficit ad excludendum errorem contrarium. In libris autem theologorum res proponitur cum aliqua determinatione maiori, quæ certe immediate deducitur ex definitione, sed tamen in illa non invenitur. Theologus autem habet determinationem maiorem, quia hic præcise est unus ex scopis præcipuis theologiæ : deducere ex principiis fidei conclusiones, ut comprehensio et extensio dogmatis distincte pateat in suis consequentiis. | | For councils are accustomed to observe this rule: in defining, they choose some sufficiently generic formula which can be explained according to various theological systems; because the council wishes, so to speak, to respect or preserve all systems, provided they are not evidently false. Wherefore they define the minimum which suffices to exclude the contrary error. In the books of theologians, however, the matter is set forth with some greater determination, which certainly is immediately deduced from the definition, but nevertheless is not found in it. The theologian, however, possesses a greater determination, because this is precisely one of the chief aims of theology: to deduce conclusions from the principles of faith, so that the comprehension and extension of the dogma may be distinctly evident in its consequences. |
| *Dico quod ita augetur comprehensio textus:* v.g. est definitum factum inspirationis et illud analyzando pervenio ad illa tria elementa: motionem in voluntatem, illustrationem in intellectum, assistentiam in executione. *Extensio:* est dogma quod Christus passus est pro nobis; extendo illud et dico etiam pro omnibus hominibus. Do multa alia exempla. | | *I say that thus the comprehension of the text is increased:* for example, the fact of inspiration is defined, and analyzing it I arrive at those three elements: motion in the will, illumination in the intellect, assistance in execution. *Extension:* it is a dogma that Christ suffered for us; I extend it and say also for all men. I give many other examples. |
| *Existentia Dei demonstrari potest:* Concilium dicit: "cognosci". Saltem theologice certum est quod anima sit immortalis natura sua, quia Concilium dicit quod est immortalis. Quod protoparentes constituti sint in gratia, est saltem theologice certum; Concilium dicit quod constituti sunt in iustitia et sanctitate originali: et hoc est dogma fidei. | | *The existence of God can be demonstrated:* The Council says: "can be known." At least it is theologically certain that the soul is immortal by its nature, because the Council says that it is immortal. That the first parents were constituted in grace is at least theologically certain; the Council says that they were constituted in original justice and holiness: and this is a dogma of faith. |
| *Quod peccatum originale non consistat formaliter in concupiscentia* est theologice certum, quia definitum est quod peccatum originale per baptismum aufertur et tamen concupiscentia manet. | | *That original sin does not formally consist in concupiscence* is theologically certain, because it is defined that original sin is taken away by baptism and yet concupiscence remains. |
| *De tenendis in Concilio Vaticano:* (Dz 1839) definit "tenendum": non dicit "credendum": ex quo deducitur esse infallibilis etiam in veritatibus connexis, quod est theologice certum. De iustitia quod non sit mere forensis est definitum; est saltem theologice certum quod sit aliquid permanens physice in anima nostra. | | *Concerning what must be held from the Vatican Council:* (Dz 1839) it defines "to be held": it does not say "to be believed": from which it is deduced that [the Church] is also infallible in connected truths, which is theologically certain. Concerning justification, that it is not merely forensic is defined; it is at least theologically certain that it is something remaining physically in our soul. |
| ### II. QUOMODO EX DOGMATE DEDUCANTUR THEOLOGICE CERTA[^4] | | ### II. HOW THEOLOGICALLY CERTAIN TRUTHS ARE DEDUCED FROM DOGMA[^4] |
| Ex aliquo dogmate videbis quid sit theologice certum si : | | You will see what is theologically certain from any dogma if: |
| a)\ ante omnia eliminas quæ non sunt definitæ; et hæc sunt: vox ipsa, imago phantastica, conceptus technicus; | | a)\ before all else you eliminate what has not been defined; and these are: the word itself, the phantastic image, the technical concept; |
| b)\ deinde præcise discernas punctum definitum; | | b)\ then you precisely discern the defined point; |
| c)\ demum si attente consideres quæ necessario ab hoc dogmate præsupponuntur vel cum eo sunt necessario connexa, vel ab eo necessario deducuntur. | | c)\ finally, if you attentively consider what is necessarily presupposed by this dogma or is necessarily connected with it, or is necessarily deduced from it. |
| **1. Voces, ut patet, non sunt definitæ.** | | **1. Words, as is evident, are not defined.** |
| Si quis velit adhibere alium terminum ad significandam revelationem supernaturalem, vel mysterium, vel dogma, vel fidem, vel Trinitatem, vel unionem hypostaticam, vel gratiam, non est hæreticus: verba enim sunt signa conventionalia, licet in usu verborum nemo debeat recedere a sensu communi: ideo Apostolus prohibuit etiam vocum novitates, quia sola vox male electa potest esse causa multarum litium et revolutionum (cf. "*liberté, égalité, fraternité*"). Fere omnia quæ explicantur in nostris universitatibus modernis sunt profanæ vocum novitates. | | If anyone wishes to employ another term to signify supernatural revelation, or mystery, or dogma, or faith, or the Trinity, or hypostatic union, or grace, he is not a heretic: for words are conventional signs, although in the use of words no one ought to depart from the common sense: therefore the Apostle also forbade novelties of expression, because a single poorly chosen word can be the cause of many disputes and revolutions (cf. "*liberté, égalité, fraternité*"). Nearly all things that are explained in our modern universities are profane novelties of expression. |
| **2. Sed neque imago phantasiæ, ut patet, est definita:** | | **2. But neither is the phantasm of the imagination defined, as is evident:** |
| "Descendit ad inferos"; "Tunc dicet rex iis qui a sinistris erunt"; "sedet ad dexteram Patris"; "inspiratio Spiritus Sancti". | | "He descended into hell"; "Then the king shall say to those who shall be on his left hand"; "he sitteth at the right hand of the Father"; "the inspiration of the Holy Spirit". |
| **3. Quando datur aliqua definitio a Conciliis vel a Papa, conceptus qui est definitus est conceptus communis, prout intelligitur ab omnibus, et non conceptus technicus aut systematicus proprius alicuius systematis.** | | **3. When any definition is given by Councils or by the Pope, the concept which is defined is the common concept, as it is understood by all, and not a technical or systematic concept proper to some particular system.** |
| Do exempla multa et celeberrima: | | Here are many most celebrated examples: |
| *Quod anima sit forma corporis* (Dz. 481): conceptus technicus est conceptus aristotelicus formæ cum suis relationibus; hic conceptus non est definitus; sed Concilium voluit hoc definire: quod anima et corpus efficiunt unum et non merum compositum casuale vel accidentale, et quod anima est elementum specificum, seu perfectivum, seu formale corporis; aliis verbis, id ex quo corpus habet quod sit corpus hominis, et non animalis, est anima. | | *That the soul is the form of the body* (Dz. 481): the technical concept is the Aristotelian concept of form with its relations; this concept is not defined; but the Council wished to define this: that the soul and body effect a unity and not a merely casual or accidental composite, and that the soul is the specific, or perfective, or formal element of the body; in other words, that from which the body has that it is a human body, and not that of an animal, is the soul. |
| *Voluit ergo definire factum unionis, ut patet pro mysterio Incarnationis:* quia si esset unio accidentalis, passio corporis non fuisset passio alicuius animæ rationalis et liberæ, et periret tota redemptio quia periret passio quæ facta est in corpore Christi. Unde si quis velit esse Carthesianus vel atomista, non est contra Concilium, licet difficillime possit cohærere cum verbis eius. | | *He wished, therefore, to define the fact of the union, as is evident in the case of the mystery of the Incarnation:* because if the union were accidental, the passion of the body would not have been the passion of any rational and free soul, and the entire redemption would perish because the passion which took place in the body of Christ would perish. Hence if anyone should wish to be a Cartesian or an atomist, it is not contrary to the Council, although he could cohere only with the greatest difficulty with its words. |
| Ita notiones Personæ et Naturæ quæ sunt definitæ in mysterio Trinitatis et Incarnationis (Dz. 428-429), non sunt definitiones technicæ aristotelicæ, scilicet pro natura: principium motus et quietis in eo in quo est et non secundum accidens; pro persona: rationalis naturæ individua substantia. | | Thus the notions of Person and Nature which are defined in the mystery of the Trinity and the Incarnation (Dz. 428-429) are not technical Aristotelian definitions, namely for nature: the principle of motion and rest in that in which it is and not accidentally; for person: an individual substance of a rational nature. |
| Sed pro natura intelligitur in dogmate id ex quo aliquid constituitur tale, v.g. homo, et per quod distinguitur ab angelo et ab animali; et pro persona: sensus alicuius individui rationalis ab alio pariter individuo plene distincti, quo dicitur: aliquis, aliquis homo, et per quod respondetur ad interrogationem: quis est ? Est Petrus vel Paulus. Dum natura respondet ad interrogationem: Quid est ? Est petra, vel equus, vel homo, vel Deus. | | But by nature in dogma is understood that from which something is constituted as such, e.g., man, and by which it is distinguished from an angel and from an animal; and by person: the sense of some rational individual fully distinct from another equally individual, by which is said: someone, some man, and by which one answers the question: who is it? It is Peter or Paul. While nature answers the question: What is it? It is a stone, or a horse, or a man, or God. |
| Ita de gratia quæ est causa formalis iustificationis (Dz. 799): causa formalis id significat quod gratia est aliquid intrinsecum in nobis ex quo sumus realiter iusti; sed non est definitus sensus stricte Aristotelicus de aliquo comprincipio quod ut actus componat cum potentia seu cum materia. | | So also concerning grace which is the formal cause of justification (Dz. 799): formal cause signifies that grace is something intrinsic in us from which we are really just; but the strictly Aristotelian sense of some co-principle which as act is composed with potency or with matter is not defined. |
| Ita de lumine rationis (Dz. 1806) et de conversione: in Eucharistia (Dz. 877). | | So it is concerning the light of reason (Dz. 1806) and concerning conversion in the Eucharist (Dz. 877). |
| **4. Do nunc aliquam synthesim conceptuum communium omnium et conceptuum systematicorum.** | | **4. Now give some synthesis of the concepts common to all and of systematic concepts.** |
| **a) Principia communia et immutabilia:** | | **a) Common and immutable principles:** |
| > Hæc sunt puncta doctrinæ in quibus omnes theologi catholici conveniunt et convenire debent et ex quibus coniunctis cum revelatis deduci possunt veritates theologice certæ. | | > These are the points of doctrine in which all Catholic theologians agree and ought to agree, and from which, when conjoined with revealed truths, theologically certain truths can be deduced. |
| Ipsa etiam ut præsupposita in definitione sunt saltem theologice certa: (ex synthesi philosophiæ). | | These themselves, as presuppositions in the definition, are at least theologically certain: (from a synthesis of philosophy). |
| i)\ Quod existit veritas et quod sumus capaces cognoscendi veritatem, contra scepticismum (cf. thesim de Deo uno). | | i)\ That truth exists and that we are capable of knowing the truth, against skepticism (cf. the thesis concerning the one God). |
| ii)\ Obiectivitas cognitionis, contra idealismum seu immanentiam (cf. damnatum Modernismum). | | ii)\ The objectivity of knowledge, against idealism or immanentism (cf. the condemned Modernism). |
| iii)\ Quod veritas sit absoluta, i.e. eadem pro omnibus; contra relativismum: nam si verum esset solum quod nunc appareret, nulla daretur norma comparationis ad distinguendum inter verum et falsum; unde omnis affirmatio æquivaleret suæ negationi. | | iii)\ That truth is absolute, i.e., the same for all; against relativism: for if only that which now appeared were true, no standard of comparison would be given for distinguishing between the true and the false; whence every affirmation would be equivalent to its negation. |
| iv)\ Quod conceptus nostri, saltem aliquomodo, sunt universales: nam si nullam admittis universalitatem nulla esset distinctio inter naturam et personam, et mysteria Trinitatis et Incarnationis esset contradictio. | | iv)\ That our concepts are, at least in some way, universal: for if you admit no universality, there would be no distinction between nature and person, and the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation would be a contradiction. |
| v)\ Quod certitudo mere naturalis, licet non scientifica, est tamen vera, v.g. in fide hominum simplicium. | | v)\ That merely natural certitude, although not scientific, is nevertheless true, e.g., in the faith of simple people. |
| vi)\ Quod homo est capax ratiocinandi; est enim theologice certum quod potest demonstrare existentiam Dei. | | vi)\ That man is capable of reasoning; for it is theologically certain that he can demonstrate the existence of God. |
| vii)\ Atque ideo: prima principia entis ut contradictionis, rationis sufficientis, causalitatis, finalitatis. Quare non potes dicere: secundum logicam Kantianam vel Hegelianam hæc principia non habent sensum; nam illa logica est *absolute hæretica*. | | vii)\ And therefore: the first principles of being, such as [the principles] of contradiction, sufficient reason, causality, [and] finality. Wherefore you cannot say: according to Kantian or Hegelian logic these principles have no meaning; for that logic is *absolutely heretical*. |
| viii)\ Obiectivitas relationum, ut causalitatis, similitudinis: ad cognoscendam existentiam et essentiam Dei, quod est dogma contra agnosticos. | | viii)\ The objectivity of relations, such as causality [and] similarity: for knowing the existence and essence of God, which is a dogma against the agnostics. |
| ix)\ Aliquomodo: existentia substantiæ et accidentis (licet non necessario cum omnibus determinationibus Aristotelicis). Nam secus non posset explicari Transubstantiatio et gratia quæ non est idem ac anima et tamen est in anima. | | ix)\ In some manner: the existence of substance and accident (although not necessarily with all the Aristotelian determinations). For otherwise Transubstantiation and grace could not be explained—[grace] which is not the same as the soul and yet is in the soul. |
| x)\ Quod dantur mutationes: nam est dogma quod homo potest amittere gratiam, et quod in ea potest crescere. | | x)\ That changes occur: for it is a dogma that man can lose grace, and that he can grow in it. |
| xi)\ Distinctiones rationis cum fundamento in re; v.g. in Trinitate. | | xi)\ Distinctions of reason with foundation in reality; for example, in the Trinity. |
| xii)\ Quod existant extensa seu corpora. | | xii)\ That extended things or bodies exist. |
| xiii)\ Quod esse in loco et in tempore dicant aliquid reale, seu quod tempus et spatium habeant fundamentum in re; nam aliter non haberet sensum quod Christus vixerit tali loco vel tempore. | | xiii)\ That being in place and in time signify something real, or that time and space have foundation in reality; for otherwise it would have no meaning that Christ lived in such a place or time. |
| xiv)\ In genere quod existat ens spirituale, contra materialismum. | | xiv)\ In general, that spiritual being exists, against materialism. |
| xv)\ Quod homo habeat animam spiritualem et immortalem. | | xv)\ That man has a spiritual and immortal soul. |
| xvi)\ Quod anima in homine sit una tantum: quia si dicis quod anima sensitiva est alia ab intellectiva, dolores sensibiles Christi non fuissent dolores alicuius animæ spiritualis. | | xvi)\ That in man the soul is only one: because if you say that the sensitive soul is other than the intellectual soul, the sensible sufferings of Christ would not have been the sufferings of any spiritual soul. |
| xvii)\ Quod homo est homo ex unione animæ et corporis: anima est forma corporis. | | xvii)\ That man is man from the union of soul and body: the soul is the form of the body. |
| xviii)\ Quod in homine sensus non sunt omnino idem ac intellectus, quia distinguitur concupiscentia a peccato. | | xviii)\ That in man the senses are not altogether the same as the intellect, because concupiscence is distinguished from sin. |
| xix)\ Quod homo habet liberum arbitrium (est dogma). | | xix)\ That man has free will (this is a dogma). |
| xx)\ Quod homo potest cognoscere et demonstrare existentiam Dei. | | xx)\ That man can know and demonstrate the existence of God. |
| xxi)\ Qui Deus non est idem ac mundus, contra pantheismum. | | xxi)\ That God is not the same as the world, against pantheism. |
| xxii)\ Quod est personalis, liber atque ideo potest loqui nobiscum. | | xxii)\ That He is personal, free, and therefore can speak with us. |
| xxiii)\ Et quod Illum cognoscimus ut personalem, quia cognoscimus ut principium et finem. | | xxiii)\ And that we know Him as personal, because we know Him as beginning and end. |
| xxiv)\ Quod homo ad religionem teneatur, et si Deus loquatur, quod teneatur Illum audire. | | xxiv)\ That man is bound to religion, and if God should speak, that he is bound to hear Him. |
| xxv)\ Quod ex ipsa natura rerum existit discrimen inter bonum et malum; quod discrimen homo potest cognoscere; et quod ideo teneatur ad bonum faciendum et malum vitandum. | | xxv)\ That from the very nature of things there exists a distinction between good and evil; that man can know this distinction; and that therefore he is bound to do good and avoid evil. |
| xxvi)\ Quod est facile cognoscere et facere primas applicationes saltem legis naturalis: ut amare parentes, non occidere, adiuvare proximum. | | xxvi)\ That it is easy to know and to make at least the first applications of the natural law: such as to love parents, not to kill, to help one's neighbor. |
| *Hæc principia sunt patrimonium commune totius generis humani in omni tempore*; systemata contingentia mutantur, hæc non mutantur; sunt autem necessaria ad cogitandum et ad affirmandum dogma. | | *These principles are the common patrimony of the entire human race in all time*; contingent systems change, but these do not change; they are, moreover, necessary for thinking and for affirming dogma. |
| Si qua theologia vel philosophia hæc in dubium revocat vel de his nullo modo loquatur, est plene hæretica, docente etiam Encyclica *HUMANI GENERIS*: | | If any theology or philosophy calls these things into doubt or in no way speaks of these things, it is fully heretical, as the Encyclical *HUMANI GENERIS* also teaches: |
| > "ea quæ communi consensu a catholicis doctoribus composita per plura sæcula fuere ad aliquam dogmatis intelligentiam attingendam, tam caduco fundamento procul dubio non nituntur. Nituntur enim principiis ac notionibus ex vera rerum creatarum cognitione deductis; in quibus quidem deducendis cognitionibus humanæ menti veritas divinitus revelata, quasi stella, per Ecclesiam illuxit. Quare mirum non est aliquas hujusmodi notiones a Conciliis Œcumenicis non solum adhibitas, sed etiam sancitas esse, *ita ut ab eis discedere nefas sit*." (p. 566) | | > "those things which were composed by common consensus of Catholic doctors over many centuries for the purpose of attaining some understanding of dogma, without doubt do not rest upon so fragile a foundation. For they rest upon principles and notions deduced from a true knowledge of created things; in which deductions, indeed, the divinely revealed truth shone forth, like a star, through the Church upon the human mind. Wherefore it is not surprising that some notions of this kind have not only been employed by Ecumenical Councils, but have even been sanctioned, *so that it is wrong to depart from them*." (p. 566) |
| Et propter hanc rationem docet eadem Encyclica quod omnes *etiam in rebus philosophicis*, qua par est reverentia animum intendere debent ad magisterium Ecclesiæ, "cuius profecto est, ex divina institutione, non solum veritatis divinitus revelatæ depositum custodire et interpretari, sed ipsis etiam philosophicis disciplinis invigilare, ne quid detrimenti ex placitis non rectis catholica patiantur dogmata" (p. 575). | | And for this reason the same Encyclical teaches that all, *even in philosophical matters*, must direct their mind with due reverence to the magisterium of the Church, "whose office it certainly is, by divine institution, not only to guard and interpret the deposit of divinely revealed truth, but also to keep watch over the philosophical disciplines themselves, lest Catholic dogmas suffer any harm from incorrect theories" (p. 575). |
| **b) Puncta systematica:** | | **b) Systematic Points:** |
| Alia e contra sunt puncta quædam systematica: | | Others, on the contrary, are certain systematic points: |
| i)\ Principium actus et potentiæ; | | i)\ The principle of act and potency; |
| ii)\ distinctio realis inter naturam et persona; | | ii)\ the real distinction between nature and person; |
| iii)\ distinctio materiæ et formæ, essentiæ et existentiæ in rebus creati; | | iii)\ the distinction of matter and form, of essence and existence in created things; |
| iv)\ quod facultates, habitus et actus specificantur ab obiecto formali; | | iv)\ that faculties, habits, and acts are specified by their formal object; |
| v)\ de quantitate, de qualitatibus; | | v)\ concerning quantity, concerning qualities; |
| vi)\ de diversis prædicamentis specifice intellecti; | | vi)\ concerning diverse predicaments specifically understood; |
| vii)\ de principio vitali in brutis; | | vii)\ concerning the vital principle in brute animals; |
| viii)\ de speciebus in cognitione; | | viii)\ concerning species in cognition; |
| ix)\ de intellectu agente; | | ix)\ concerning the agent intellect; |
| x)\ de quinque viis specifice intellectis. | | x)\ concerning the five ways specifically understood. |
| Istæ sunt theses quas Magisterium ecclesiasticum præfert inter alias, sed quas non supponit in suis definitionibus, licet verba definitionum desumantur ex hoc systemate. | | These are the theses which the ecclesiastical Magisterium prefers among others, but which it does not presuppose in its definitions, although the words of the definitions are drawn from this system. |
| Nota enim quod ista omnia possunt adhiberi ad significandos conceptus communes, quia aliqua distinctio inter essentiam et esse, inter actum et potentiam, est absolute necessaria. | | Note, moreover, that all these things can be employed to signify common concepts, because some distinction between essence and existence, between act and potency, is absolutely necessary. |
| Ita conceptus naturæ: est notio communis et necessaria pro theologia hoc sensu quod in omnibus hominibus sit aliquid identicum et stabile quod possumus cognoscere et relate ad quod possumus dicere cum infallibili certitudine: hoc ei debetur, illud non debetur. | | Thus the concept of nature: it is a common and necessary notion for theology in this sense, that in all men there be something identical and stable which we can know and in relation to which we can say with infallible certitude: this is owed to it, that is not owed to it. |
| *Ex his thesibus applicatis ad propositiones revelatas, non deducitur propositio theologice certa*, neque hæc potes dicere theologice certa præcise quia non præsupponuntur in conciliis. (Thesis de diverso obiecto formali supernaturali in fide, licet videatur vera, non est plus quam probabilior). Notiones istæ sunt technicæ seu systematicæ; istæ non definiuntur; seu: *quæ definiuntur a concilio vel a Pontifice non sunt propria alicuius solius systematis*. | | *From these theses applied to revealed propositions, no theologically certain proposition is deduced*, nor can you call this theologically certain precisely because they are not presupposed in the councils. (The thesis concerning the diverse supernatural formal object in faith, although it seems true, is no more than more probable). These notions are technical or systematic; these are not defined; or rather: *what is defined by a council or by a Pontiff does not belong properly to any one system alone*. |
| ### III. DE DUPLICE RATIONE ALIQUID DEDUCENDI EX DOGMATE | | ### III. ON THE TWOFOLD MANNER OF DEDUCING SOMETHING FROM DOGMA |
| **a) Unice a priori** | | **a) Solely a priori** |
| > Inter propositiones theologice certas quædam obtinentur via ratiocinii unice a priori: istæ vocantur a quibusdam *theologice certæ*, ab aliis *implicite revelatæ*. | | > Among theologically certain propositions, certain ones are obtained by way of reasoning solely a priori: these are called by some *theologically certain*, by others *implicitly revealed*. |
| Et certe dici possunt *implicite revelatæ* si deductio fieri potest cum omni certitudine et vere a priori, i.e. adhibendo solum prima principia rationis. Nam veritates revelatæ in tantum intelliguntur a nobis in quantum sunt proiectæ in nostram mentem et receptæ, assimilatæ, comprehensæ a nostra ratione cum suo apparatu primorum principiorum necessariorum. | | And certainly they can be called *implicitly revealed* if the deduction can be made with complete certitude and truly a priori, i.e., by employing only the first principles of reason. For revealed truths are understood by us insofar as they are projected into our mind and received, assimilated, and comprehended by our reason with its apparatus of necessary first principles. |
| Quare si adhibendo hæc prima principia nos in lucem ponimus diversos aspectus dati revelati obiective initialis, non concludimus ad veritates vere novas. Sicut construitur metaphysica generalis proficiscendo ab aliquo dato initiali, i.e. a cogitatione humana obiectiva, sine recursu ad experientiam, quia ista est scientia legum necessariarum cogitationis obiectivæ, legum entis, atque ideo non habentur veritates vere novæ sed maior explicitatio alicuius obiecti per viam analysis: ita idem modus analyzandi aliquod obiectum secundum suas partes essentiales in theologia non est aliud nisi ratiocinium explicativum per quod deducuntur formaliter implicite revelata. | | Wherefore, if by employing these first principles we bring to light diverse aspects of the initially given objective revealed datum, we do not conclude to truths that are truly new. Just as general metaphysics is constructed by proceeding from some initial given datum, i.e., from objective human thought, without recourse to experience, because it is the science of the necessary laws of objective thought, the laws of being, and therefore one does not obtain truths that are truly new but rather a greater explication of some object by way of analysis: so likewise the same mode of analyzing some object according to its essential parts in theology is nothing other than explicative reasoning by which formally implicitly revealed truths are deduced. |
| Sic inveniuntur partes in toto et vice versa (Sacram. 7); ita elementa alicuius definitionis in obiecto quod cognoscitur; ita ideæ particulares in idea generali. | | Thus parts are found in the whole and vice versa (seven Sacraments); likewise the elements of some definition are found in the object that is known; likewise particular ideas are found in the general idea. |
| Si vocas has propositiones theologice certas, certe tamen hæ propositiones videntur definiri posse de fide catholica. In his enim ratiocinatio solum deservit ad explicandum sensum præmissæ quæ est revelata et quatenus est revelata. | | If you call these propositions theologically certain, nevertheless these propositions seem capable of being defined as matters of Catholic faith. For in these matters reasoning serves only to explain the meaning of a premise which is revealed and insofar as it is revealed. |
| **b) Addito facto contingenti** | | **b) With the Addition of a Contingent Fact** |
| Si explicitatio fiat recurrendo ad aliquam veritatem facti, tunc est classis sequens. | | If the explication is made by recourse to some truth of fact, then there is the following class. |
| Est classis illarum conclusionum quarum genesis supponit introductionem in ratiocinio alicuius veritatis non revelatæ sed cognitæ per experientiam. | | This is the class of those conclusions whose genesis supposes the introduction into the reasoning of some truth that is not revealed but known through experience. |
| Facta dogmatica sunt illa quæ ut elementa facti ingrediuntur in aliquam propositionem quam nemo potest negare vel ut de fide vel ut theologice certam: quod Ecclesia sit infallibilis in facto dogmatico est saltem theologice certum. | | Dogmatic facts are those which as elements of fact enter into some proposition which no one can deny either as a matter of faith or as theologically certain: that the Church is infallible in dogmatic fact is at least theologically certain. |
| Enumerantur omnia ista: | | All these are enumerated: |
| i)\ factum legitimitatis alicuius Papæ vel alicuius concilii, ut Tridentini, (ingreditur ut elementum facti in omnibus dogmatibus Concilii Tridentini). | | i)\ the fact of the legitimacy of some Pope or of some council, such as Trent, (it enters as an element of fact in all the dogmas of the Council of Trent). |
| ii)\ sensus alicuius propositionis vel alicuius libri in relatione ad fidem (cf. Jansenium). | | ii)\ the meaning of some proposition or of some book in relation to the faith (cf. Jansenius). |
| iii)\ character hæreticalis alicuius personæ (Nestorius, Wiclef): hoc potest esse necesse definire ne fideles inficiantur ab eorum doctrina. | | iii)\ the heretical character of some person (Nestorius, Wyclif): it may be necessary to define this lest the faithful be infected by their doctrine. |
| iv)\ orthodoxia alicuius Patris Ecclesiæ vel alicuius eius libri. | | iv)\ the orthodoxy of some Father of the Church or of some book of his. |
| v)\ sanctitas alicuius personæ (in canonizatione). | | v)\ the sanctity of some person (in canonization). |
| vi)\ nullitas vel realitas talis ordinationis, v.g. Anglicanorum. | | vi)\ the nullity or reality of such an ordination, for example, that of the Anglicans. |
| vii)\ valor sanctificationis talis ordinis religiosi (approbatio ordinum religiosorum; non eo ipso omnes regulæ in particulari approbantur ut meliores). | | vii)\ the value of the sanctification of such a religious order (the approbation of religious orders; not thereby are all rules in particular approved as better). |
| viii)\ authenticitas Vulgatæ. | | viii)\ the authenticity of the Vulgate. |
| ix)\ factum talis obligationis quæ oritur ex tali lege ecclesiastica, v.g. sese confitendi semel in anno, vel communicandi in Pascha. | | ix)\ the fact of such an obligation which arises from such an ecclesiastical law, for example, of confessing oneself once a year, or of communicating at Easter. |
| x)\ existentia sacramentalium. | | x)\ the existence of sacramentals. |
| xi)\ existentia talium impedimentorum in matrimonio. | | xi)\ the existence of such impediments in matrimony. |
| Parum refert si non possumus dirimere quæstionem utrum quædam ex iis factis sint dogmata vel solum theologice certa: nam ex una parte videntur revelata hæc particularia: hoc ens creatum est, hic homo redemptus est, Concilium Tridentinum est infallibile, hic Papa est infallibilis: quia in iis casibus non fit additio Revelationis sed explicatio vel applicatio eius; ex alia tamen parte sciendum est quod multa in genere a Deo revelantur, ut credantur solum in genere: nam ego non teneor ad faciendum actum fidei quod hic puer sit natus in peccato originali, vel quod hic Papa sit infallibilis: sed teneor ad faciendum seu eliciendum actum fidei circa illa quæ ipse definiat. | | It matters little if we cannot resolve the question whether certain of these facts are dogmas or only theologically certain: for on the one hand these particular things seem to be revealed: this being is created, this man is redeemed, the Council of Trent is infallible, this Pope is infallible: because in these cases there is no addition to Revelation but an explication or application of it; on the other hand, however, it must be known that many things are revealed by God in general, so that they are to be believed only in general: for I am not bound to make an act of faith that this child is born in original sin, or that this Pope is infallible: but I am bound to make or elicit an act of faith concerning those things which he himself defines. |
| Vel potes dicere quod quædam revelantur seu dicuntur a Deo non iam ad faciendum seu eliciendum actum fidei, sed per accidens vel cum ordine ad articulos fidei (ex. de pænula S. Pauli). | | Or you can say that certain things are revealed or spoken by God no longer for the purpose of making or eliciting an act of faith, but per accidens or in relation to the articles of faith (for example, concerning the cloak of St. Paul). |
| Deus enim loquendo nobiscum sese accommodat moribus humanis, sicut orator quædam dicit per accidens seu per transennam. | | For God, in speaking with us, accommodates Himself to human customs, just as an orator says certain things incidentally or obliquely. |
| Propono alio modo punctum præcedens difficillimum: relate ad ea quæ deduci possunt, seu: | | I propose in another manner the preceding most difficult point: in relation to those things which can be deduced, namely: |
| Relate ad virtualiter revelata, distinguendi sunt duo casus: | | In relation to virtually revealed truths, two cases must be distinguished: |
| i)\ quædam conclusiones obtinentur ex dogmate mediante ratiocinio unice a priori, id est sine recursu ad experientiam seu ad aliquod factum contingens. In talibus conclusionibus est valde difficile definire præcise quænam sint formaliter implicite revelatæ, quænam e contra solum virtualiter implicite revelatæ; *videtur non admittenda illa distinctio inter syllogismum mere ostensivum, et syllogismum vere illativum.* | | i)\ certain conclusions are obtained from dogma by means of reasoning uniquely *a priori*, that is, without recourse to experience or to any contingent fact. In such conclusions it is very difficult to define precisely which are formally implicitly revealed, which on the contrary are only virtually implicitly revealed; *it seems that distinction between a merely ostensive syllogism and a truly illative syllogism should not be admitted.* |
| Nam ante definitionem Ecclesiæ tales conclusiones vocantur theologice certæ, ut Immaculata ante definitionem; post definitionem veniunt theologi et dicunt fidentes: illa est formaliter implicite revelata. De facto in his conclusionibus habetur vel solum novus conceptus eiusdem realitatis: sicut quando dico: est dogma cognitio Dei, ergo est theologice certa demonstratio: demonstratio enim est conceptus magis determinatus cognitionis; vel habetur proprietas quæ in realitate definita continetur ut in radice: est dogma quod Christus sit homo: ergo est theologice certum quod sit risibilis. | | For before the definition of the Church such conclusions are called theologically certain, as the Immaculate [Conception] before the definition; after the definition theologians come and say confidently: that is formally implicitly revealed. In fact in these conclusions there is had either only a new concept of the same reality: just as when I say: the knowledge of God is a dogma, therefore demonstration is theologically certain: for demonstration is a more determined concept of knowledge; or there is had a property which is contained in the defined reality as in a root: it is a dogma that Christ is man: therefore it is theologically certain that He is capable of laughter. |
| Istæ conclusiones possunt dici implicite revelatæ si deductio fieri potest cum *vera certitudine adhibendo solum prima principia rationis*. In his valet plene ratiocinium Suresii et Lugonis; tales conclusiones possunt definiri et sunt credendæ de fide divina et catholica. | | These conclusions can be said to be implicitly revealed if the deduction can be made with *true certitude employing only the first principles of reason*. In these matters the reasoning of Suresius and Lugo is fully valid; such conclusions can be defined and are to be believed with divine and Catholic faith. |
| *Unica ratio quare sæpe non possunt definiri est quia non sunt certæ,* quia deducuntur cum aliqua minori rationis quæ non est absolute certa. Sed si propositio rationis esset absolute certa et a priori, certe conclusio posset definiri. | | *The sole reason why they often cannot be defined is that they are not certain,* because they are deduced with some minor premise of reason which is not absolutely certain. But if the premise of reason were absolutely certain and a priori, certainly the conclusion could be defined. |
| *Et de facto tales conclusiones intrant in illam categoriam quam approbant auctores quando dicunt quod formaliter implicite revelatum est definitio in definito, conclusio in præmissis*: illi conceptus novi, illæ proprietates, pertinent ad definitionem rei: nam nemo potest cum certitudine distinguere semper inter essentiam et proprietatem essentialem, et in eiusmodi distinctionibus continetur semper aliquid arbitrarietatis. | | *And in fact such conclusions fall into that category which the authorities approve when they say that what is formally implicitly revealed is the definition in the defined, the conclusion in the premises*: those new concepts, those properties, pertain to the definition of the thing: for no one can always distinguish with certainty between essence and essential property, and in distinctions of this kind there is always contained something of arbitrariness. |
| *Et amplius: si tales conclusiones non possent definiri, nihil potest definiri novi nisi quod est expressis verbis in Scriptura*: nam in omni syllogismo nos adhibemus prima principia rationis; v.g. ad deducendum quod Filius est consubstantialis Patri ex eo quod Christus dicit: "ego et Pater unum sumus", adhibeo principium identitatis et contradictionis. | | *And furthermore: if such conclusions could not be defined, nothing new could be defined except what is in express words in Scripture*: for in every syllogism we employ the first principles of reason; for example, to deduce that the Son is consubstantial with the Father from the fact that Christ says: "I and the Father are one," I employ the principle of identity and contradiction. |
| Supponamus nunc quod sit vera sententia thomistica quod persona constituatur a propria existentia, cur non posset definiri quod in Christo est tantum unum esse ? Ratio præcise quare hoc non potest definiri non est quia thesis illa de una existentia in una persona est veritas nova, sed quia non est veritas certa. | | Let us now suppose that the Thomistic opinion is true that a person is constituted by its own existence, why could it not be defined that in Christ there is only one being? The reason precisely why this cannot be defined is not because that thesis concerning one existence in one person is a new truth, but because it is not a certain truth. |
| Omnes auctores dicunt: qui testatur aliquam veritatem formaliter explicite, implicite testatur omne illud quod sub his circumstantiis, et etiam futuris pro Deo, audienti est eadem veritas. Iamvero audientes possunt esse diversi: si Christus dicit coram operario aliquo: "ego et Pater unum sumus", ille fere nihil intelligit; si dicit coram theologo, theologus dicit: est consubstantialis Patri; et in fine mundi quando cognitio Revelationis ex parte Ecclesiæ erit maior, melius adhuc intelligent illam veritatem et quæ necessario ex illa deducuntur possunt omnia dici formaliter implicite revelata. | | All authors say: whoever formally and explicitly testifies to some truth, implicitly testifies to all that which under these circumstances, and also in the future for God, is the same truth to the one hearing. Now indeed, hearers can be diverse: if Christ says before some workman: "I and the Father are one," he understands almost nothing; if He says this before a theologian, the theologian says: He is consubstantial with the Father; and at the end of the world when the knowledge of Revelation on the part of the Church will be greater, they will understand still better that truth, and all things which are necessarily deduced from it can be said to be formally implicitly revealed. |
| Unde quod dicebant theologi veteres est verissimum: illæ consequentiæ sunt implicite revelatæ quæ deducuntur ex revelata veritate, bona et necessaria consequentia. | | Whence what the ancient theologians said is most true: those consequences are implicitly revealed which are deduced from revealed truth by good and necessary consequence. |
| ii)\ Sed sunt aliæ conclusiones, non a priori sed a posteriori in quarum præmissis continetur aliquid factum contingens, v.g. sanctitatis alicuius personæ in canonizatione; vel in authentia Vulgatæ; in impedimentis matrimonii, quæ impedimenta omnino contingenter statuuntur ab Ecclesia; vel in cæremoniis Sacrificii Missæ et Sacramentorum, quæ etiam omnino contingenter statuuntur ab Ecclesia. | | ii)\ But there are other conclusions, not *a priori* but *a posteriori*, in whose premises is contained some contingent fact, e.g., the sanctity of some person in canonization; or in the authenticity of the Vulgate; in the impediments to marriage, which impediments are established by the Church in an entirely contingent manner; or in the ceremonies of the Sacrifice of the Mass and of the Sacraments, which are also established by the Church in an entirely contingent manner. |
| *Ista definiuntur et tamen non videntur revelata.* Ratio autem quare non sint credenda de fide divina et catholica videtur esse ista: adhuc non est dogma fidei quod Ecclesia in his definiendis sit infallibilis; est certum theologice. Si esset dogma, tunc etiam pro his plene valeret ratiocinium Suarezii et Lugonis: omnes definitiones Ecclesiæ, cuiuslibet generis, erunt dogmata fidei. | | *These things are defined and yet they do not appear to be revealed.* But the reason why they are not to be believed as matters of divine and Catholic faith seems to be this: it is not yet a dogma of faith that the Church in defining these matters is infallible; it is theologically certain. If it were a dogma, then even for these matters the reasoning of Suárez and Lugon would be fully valid: all definitions of the Church, of whatever kind, will be dogmas of faith. |
| *Si enim Christus dixisset: ego vobis revelo quod Ecclesia in omnibus quæ definit est infallibilis, seu dicit verum,* Christus ipse cum illa propositione generali affirmavisset veritatem illarum definitionum. Quid est enim affirmare aliquam propositionem nisi dicere: est vera ? Utique alia veritas est infallibilitas Ecclesiæ, alia veritas est propositio definita ab Ecclesia; sed sunt duæ veritates necessario connexæ: unde qui affirmat unam, affirmat etiam aliam: sicut qui dicit: "Ego et Pater unum sumus", affirmat etiam consubstantialitatem et qui affirmat principia et videt conclusiones eo ipso affirmat conclusiones quæ necessario ab ipsis videt deducendas esse. | | *For if Christ had said: I reveal to you that the Church in all things which it defines is infallible, or speaks the truth,* Christ Himself with that general proposition would have affirmed the truth of those definitions. For what is it to affirm any proposition except to say: it is true? Indeed, the infallibility of the Church is one truth, the proposition defined by the Church is another truth; but they are two truths necessarily connected: whence whoever affirms the one, also affirms the other: just as whoever says: "I and the Father are one," also affirms consubstantiality, and whoever affirms principles and sees conclusions thereby affirms the conclusions which he sees must necessarily be deduced from them. |
| *Breviter ergo:* illa quæ deducuntur cum absoluta certitudine unice a priori, videntur esse omnia revelata; unica distinctio est utrum sint implicite an explicite revelata; et de facto etiam Encyclica "HUMANI GENERIS" loquitur solum de tali distinctione, ubi dicit: | | *Briefly therefore:* those things which are deduced with absolute certainty solely from a priori reasoning, appear all to be revealed; the only distinction is whether they are implicitly or explicitly revealed; and in fact the Encyclical "HUMANI GENERIS" also speaks only of such a distinction, where it says: |
| > "Verum quoque est, theologis semper redeundum esse ad divinæ revelationis fontes: eorum enim est indicare qua ratione ea quæ a vivo Magisterio docentur, in Sacris Litteris et in divina 'traditione', *sive explicite, sive implicite* inveniantur" (p. 568). (Pius IX, *Inter gravissimas*, 28 oct. 1870, *Acta*, vol. I., p. 260). | | > "It is likewise true that theologians must always return to the sources of divine revelation: for it is their task to indicate by what reasoning those things which are taught by the living Magisterium are to be found in Sacred Scripture and in divine 'tradition,' *whether explicitly or implicitly*" (p. 568). (Pius IX, *Inter gravissimas*, 28 October 1870, *Acta*, vol. I., p. 260). |
| *Alia distinctio inter formaliter revelatum et virtualiter revelatum, quasi virtualiter revelatum definiri non possit, licet deducatur cum certitudine a revelato, videtur non esse admittenda.* | | *Another distinction between what is formally revealed and what is virtually revealed—as though what is virtually revealed cannot be defined, even though it is deduced with certainty from what is revealed—seems not to be admissible.* |
| ### IV. QUID ERGO SIT REVELATUM FORMALITER EXPLICITE, VEL IMPLICITE; QUID VIRTUALITER REVELATUM; DISTINCTIO INTER IPSA | | ### IV. WHAT THEREFORE IS FORMALLY REVEALED, WHETHER EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY; WHAT IS VIRTUALLY REVEALED; THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM |
| **1. Explico ante omnia unde desumatur distinctio rationis ratiocinantis :** | | **1. I explain before all else whence is derived the distinction of reasoning reason:** |
| ... ex diversis scilicet respectibus unius rei vel conceptus ad alias res; Homo: animal rationale (essent denominationes mere extrinsecæ); distinctio vero ratiocinatæ rei desumitur ex eadem re quæ præbet fundamentum tali distinctioni. | | ... namely, from the different relations of one thing or concept to other things; Man: rational animal (these would be merely extrinsic denominations); but the distinction of reasoned thing is derived from the same thing which provides the foundation for such a distinction. |
| Quia aliquid potest esse revelatum formaliter explicite vel formaliter implicite: quæ distinguuntur a conceptu revelato per distinctionem rationis ratiocinantis, ut Trinitas, ὁμοούσιος, unio hypostatica sunt formaliter implicite revelata; quæ distinguuntur distinctione rationis ratiocinatae sunt etiam formaliter implicite revelata, sed antequam proponantur ab Ecclesia, communiter dicuntur theologicæ certa; postquam vero proposita sunt, vera dogmata. Quæ autem distinguuntur realiter, non sunt revelata, nisi aliunde constet. | | Because something can be revealed formally explicitly or formally implicitly: those things which are distinguished from the revealed concept by a distinction of reasoning reason (*distinctio rationis ratiocinantis*), such as the Trinity, *ὁμοούσιος* [consubstantial], and hypostatic union, are formally implicitly revealed; those things which are distinguished by a distinction of reasoned reason (*distinctio rationis ratiocinatae*) are also formally implicitly revealed, but before they are proposed by the Church, they are commonly called theologically certain; after they have been proposed, however, they are true dogmas. Those things, moreover, which are distinguished really [*realiter*], are not revealed, unless it is established from another source. |
| **2. *Formaliter explicite revelatum* est id quod ipsi termini locutionis exprimunt.** | | **2. *That which is formally explicitly revealed* is that which the very terms of the expression convey.** |
| Potest fieri termino proprio: Deus fortis, Deus dixit quæ sunt in libris sacris, Verbum caro factum est, locutus est per prophetas. Potest fieri termino metaphorico: dominus exercituum, ego sum vitis vos palmites. | | This can be done by a proper term: mighty God, God has spoken what is in the sacred books, the Word was made flesh, He has spoken through the prophets. It can be done by a metaphorical term: Lord of hosts, I am the vine, you are the branches. |
| *Sed non est confundendum id quod expressis verbis in propositione aliqua significatur, cum eo quod prima fronte ex sola lectione vel auditione propositionis percipitur.* Potest enim accidere quod sensus verborum solum ex longa inquisitione innotescat et multæ sunt veritates explicite revelatæ quæ tales non apparent, nisi adhibeantur multa argumenta. | | *But that which is signified in expressed words in any proposition must not be confused with that which is perceived at first glance from the mere reading or hearing of the proposition.* For it can happen that the sense of the words becomes known only after long inquiry, and there are many truths explicitly revealed which do not appear as such unless many arguments are applied. |
| **3. *Formaliter implicite revelatum* est quod formaliter continetur in explicito revelato seu formaliter idem est cum explicite revelato.** | | **3. *That which is formally implicitly revealed* is what is formally contained in the explicitly revealed, or is formally the same as the explicitly revealed.** |
| Sic continetur: | | It is thus contained: |
| a)\ definitio in definito et vice versa: hoc est corpus meum: transubstantiatio; | | a)\ the definition in the thing defined and vice versa: this is my body: transubstantiation; |
| b)\ relativum in correlativo: ita revelata una propositione revelatum est contrariam et contradictoriam esse hæreticam; | | b)\ the relative in its correlative: thus, with one proposition having been revealed, it is revealed that the contrary and contradictory [proposition] is heretical; |
| c)\ partes physicæ essentiales in toto et totum in partibus; | | c)\ the essential physical parts in the whole and the whole in the parts; |
| d)\ propositio particularis in universali; | | d)\ the particular proposition in the universal; |
| e)\ conclusio in præmissis. Nam principium ex quo syllogismus procedit se habet ad conclusionem ut totum ad partem et conclusio se habet ad principium ut pars ad totum. Quare consequens est pars antecedentis. | | e)\ the conclusion in the premises. For the principle from which the syllogism proceeds is related to the conclusion as the whole to the part, and the conclusion is related to the principle as the part to the whole. Wherefore the consequent is part of the antecedent. |
| Do exemplum: initium fidei est actus supernaturalis; ad omnem actum supernaturalem requiritur gratia; ergo etiam ad initium fidei requiritur gratia. | | I give an example: the beginning of faith is a supernatural act; for every supernatural act grace is required; therefore for the beginning of faith also grace is required. |
| Patet quod in his ut transeam ex uno ad aliud sufficit explicatio terminorum quia quodlibet ex his ingreditur in definitionem alterius. Qui locutus est nobis in Filio, eo ipso dixit revelationem esse possibilem, dixit esse convenientem (Dz. 1807). Supra locutus sum de propositionibus quæ obtinentur a propositione revelata unice a priori seu via metaphysica: sunt istæ. | | It is evident that in these matters, in order to pass from one to another, the explication of terms suffices, because each of these enters into the definition of the other. He who has spoken to us in the Son, by that very fact has said that revelation is possible, has said that it is fitting (Dz. 1807). Above I have spoken of propositions which are obtained from a revealed proposition solely *a priori* or by the metaphysical way: these are they. |
| Do autem exempla quæ probant hæc, antequam definiantur ab Ecclesia, haberi ut theologice certa: | | I give, moreover, examples which prove that these, before they are defined by the Church, are held as theologically certain: |
| a)\ quod Trinitas, Incarnatio et Eucharistia sint mysteria ; | | a)\ that the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Eucharist are mysteries; |
| b)\ quod rationes contrariæ non sint cogentes seu evidentes ; | | b)\ that contrary arguments are not cogent or evident; |
| c)\ quod Trinitas, etiam post Revelationem divinam, non potest demonstrari sola ratione. | | c)\ that the Trinity, even after divine Revelation, cannot be demonstrated by reason alone. |
| Hic autem adverte aliquam differentiam in terminologia auctorum. De mysterio Incarnationis quidam dicunt esse doctrinam catholicam quod sit mysterium, quia Pius IX nominat illud mysterium in aliqua epistola afferendo illud ut exemplum de mysteriis, et quod rationes non sint evidentes dicunt quod est theologice certum; de Trinitate quod non possit demonstrari ; alii dicunt esse proximum fidei. | | Here, however, note a certain difference in the terminology of authors. Concerning the mystery of the Incarnation, some say it is Catholic doctrine that it is a mystery, because Pius IX names it a mystery in a certain epistle, bringing it forward as an example of mysteries, and that the reasons [for it] are not evident they say is theologically certain; concerning the Trinity, that it cannot be demonstrated; others say it is proximate to the faith. |
| **4.** Testis testando aliquam veritatem formaliter et explicite, æquivalenter seu implicite testatur omne id quod in his circumstantiis, et etiam futuris pro Deo, in verbis suis continetur. | | **4.** A witness, in bearing witness to some truth formally and explicitly, equivalently or implicitly bears witness to everything that is contained in his words in these circumstances, and also in future ones for God. |
| Hæc sunt quæ mere a priori cum firma certitudine deduci possunt a sua propositione attestata. Agitur enim de sensu locutionis attestantis. Ita qui testatur Christum esse hominem perfectum testatur eo ipso eum habere voluntatem humanam; Deus qui testatur se esse cum Apostolis usque ad finem mundi, testatur futuros quosdam successores Apostolorum (episcopos); qui testatur dari mysteria (Dz. 1796) ("loquimur Dei sapientiam in mysterio quæ abscondita est"), eo ipso revelat ad cognoscenda mysteria necessariam esse revelationem. | | These are things which can be deduced purely a priori with firm certitude from his attested proposition. For it is a question of the sense of the utterance of the one bearing witness. Thus he who bears witness that Christ is a perfect man thereby bears witness that He has a human will; God who bears witness that He is with the Apostles until the end of the world, bears witness that there will be certain successors of the Apostles (bishops); he who bears witness that mysteries are given (Dz. 1796) ("we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery which is hidden"), by that very fact reveals that revelation is necessary for knowing the mysteries. |
| **5.** Sed possunt evenire quædam adiuncta in sæculis futuris in quibus verba a Spiritu Sancto inspirata plenius intelliguntur; ut nunc nos quædam percipimus in Scriptura et Traditione quæ antea non percipiebant. | | **5.** But certain circumstances can occur in future centuries in which words inspired by the Holy Spirit are more fully understood; just as we now perceive certain things in Scripture and Tradition which previously they did not perceive. |
| Hoc criterium bene explicat quomodo nunc possit esse de fide quod antea erat v.g. solum theologice certum, vel doctrina catholica, quin tamen fiat nunc nova revelatio. | | This criterion well explains how something can now be a matter of faith which previously was, for example, only theologically certain, or Catholic doctrine, without, however, any new revelation now being made. |
| Debes enim retinere et conciliare hæc duo: | | For you must retain and reconcile these two things: |
| > i) Revelatio clausa est cum Apostolis, quod est saltem *theologice certum*. | | > i) Revelation was closed with the Apostles, which is at least *theologically certain*. |
| Nam: | | For: |
| a)\ nimis *patet ex Scriptura* quod præsens œconomia Ecclesiæ Jesu Christi est status ultimus atque supremus divinæ manifestationis pro hac conditione mortali generis humani. | | a)\ it is *too evident from Scripture* that the present economy of the Church of Jesus Christ is the ultimate and supreme state of divine manifestation for this mortal condition of the human race. |
| b)\ Christus in ultima cœna dicit Apostolis, loquendo de Spiritu Sancto: *docebit vos omnem veritatem*, scilicet totam veritatem salutarem revelandam; patet autem quod hic spectat Apostolos personaliter, nam ipsi sunt qui multa quæ Christus dicturus esset non possunt portare modo, et qui e contra, cum venerit Spiritus veritatis, docebuntur omnem veritatem. | | b)\ Christ at the Last Supper says to the Apostles, speaking of the Holy Spirit: *he will teach you all truth*, namely, the whole saving truth to be revealed; but it is clear that this regards the Apostles personally, for they are the ones who cannot now bear the many things which Christ was about to say, and who, on the contrary, when the Spirit of truth shall come, will be taught all truth. |
| c)\ Ascensurus autem in cœlum Christus dicit Apostolis: *docete eos servare omnia quæcumque mandavi vobis*; et hoc explicat quid sint illa omnia de quibus loquebatur in ultima cœna; | | c)\ Moreover, Christ ascending into heaven says to the Apostles: *teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you*; and this explains what are those all things of which He was speaking at the Last Supper; |
| d)\ S. Paulus semper commendat suis discipulis custodire depositum et prohibet recipere eos qui proferant aliquid, præter doctrinam quam "vos didicistis", quia omnes fideles sunt ædificandi supra fundamentum Apostolorum et prophetarum, et non super aliud fundamentum. | | d)\ St. Paul always commends to his disciples to guard the deposit and forbids them to receive those who put forward anything beyond the doctrine which "you have learned," because all the faithful are to be built upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets, and not upon another foundation. |
| e)\ Si quod dubium adhuc maneret, quæstio deciditur ex diserta doctrina et practico agendi modo totius Ecclesiæ. Semper enim valebat hoc principium: quidquid novum est non ad fidem pertinet, sed ad hæresim. Definire autem quod aliquod caput ad fidem catholicam pertineat est idem, secundum stilum conciliorum, quod talis doctrina ad nos pervenit ut revelata ab Apostolis, sive in divina Scriptura, sive in Traditione etiam sine scripto. | | e)\ If any doubt should still remain, the question is decided from the express teaching and practical mode of acting of the entire Church. For this principle has always held: whatever is new does not pertain to the faith, but to heresy. Moreover, to define that some article pertains to the Catholic faith is the same thing, according to the style of councils, as [to say] that such a doctrine has come down to us as revealed by the Apostles, whether in divine Scripture or in Tradition even without writing. |
| > ii) Licet autem Revelatio sit clausa, nunc tamen sunt quædam dogmata quæ antea explicite non cognoscebantur. | | > ii) Although Revelation is closed, nevertheless there are now certain dogmas which were not previously known explicitly. |
| Aliud enim est propositionem aliquam *secundum se* esse de fide, aliud vero esse *nobis* de fide. Ad primum sufficit quod sit a Deo revelata; ad secundum requiritur quod Revelationis sensus et significatio nobis constet sufficienter. | | For it is one thing for a proposition to be of the faith *in itself*, another thing indeed for it to be of the faith *for us*. For the first it suffices that it be revealed by God; for the second it is required that the sense and signification of the Revelation be sufficiently established to us. |
| Exemplum est in Scriptura: quando coram rege Baltassare scripta fuerunt in pariete verba illa: *mane, thecel, phares*, quibus significabatur quod Deus numeraverat regnum Baltassaris et quod illud regnum erat in fine; quare, posita illa scriptura, iam hæc veritas erat revelata a Deo, et Daniel, ubi primum scripturam illam legerat, debebat ex fide obiectum illud credere tanquam a Deo revelatum. Rex tamen, antequam a Daniele explicaretur de quo obiecto loqueretur Deus, non debebat nec poterat veritatem illam de fide credere. Erat ergo veritas illa iam *de fide secundum se*; regi tamen et aliis nondum erat de fide. | | An example is in Scripture: when those words were written on the wall before King Belshazzar: *mene, tekel, peres*, by which it was signified that God had numbered the kingdom of Belshazzar and that kingdom was at its end; therefore, once that writing was set forth, this truth was already revealed by God, and Daniel, as soon as he had read that writing, ought to have believed that object from faith as revealed by God. The king, however, before it was explained by Daniel concerning what object God was speaking, neither ought to have nor could have believed that truth as of the faith. Therefore that truth was already *of the faith in itself*; for the king, however, and for others it was not yet of the faith. |
| Ita Deus iam dixit nobis in Scriptura et Traditione omnia quæ volebat dicere; sed nos intelligimus secundum capacitatem nostram; in sæculis futuris non negabunt quæ nos dicimus, quia dogmata sunt immutabilia, sed *plenius intelligent*. Quis enim posset plene exponere illum textum: *Verbum caro factum est*? Quis posset exhaurire sensum illorum verborum: *Ego sum vitis, vos palmites*? | | Thus God has already said to us in Scripture and Tradition all that He wished to say; but we understand according to our capacity; in future ages they will not deny what we say, because dogmas are immutable, but *they will understand more fully*. For who could fully expound that text: *The Word was made flesh*? Who could exhaust the meaning of those words: *I am the vine, you are the branches*? |
| Unde Encyclica "Humani Generis" docet: | | Hence the Encyclical "Humani Generis" teaches: |
| > "... uterque doctrinæ divinitus revelatæ fons tot tantosque continet thesauros veritatis, ut numquam reapse exhauriatur." *(p. 568)* | | > "... each source of divinely revealed doctrine contains so many and such great treasures of truth that they can never really be exhausted." *(p. 568)* |
| Cum hoc criterio ruit totus apparatus scientificus Modernistarum, (Dz. 2039; 2040), qui putant se facessere magnam difficultatem Ecclesiæ ex eo quod quædam dogmata historice probari nequeant ex toto decursu sæculorum incipiendo ab Apostolis usque ad nos. Non est indispensabile omnia probare a sæculis præteritis: Spiritus Sanctus etiam hodie assistit Ecclesiæ atque viis nobis ignotis dirigit attentionem eius ad melius intelligenda quæ Ipse locutus est per prophetas. | | With this criterion the entire scientific apparatus of the Modernists collapses, (Dz. 2039; 2040), who think they are removing a great difficulty from the Church by the fact that certain dogmas cannot be historically proven throughout the entire course of centuries beginning from the Apostles down to us. It is not indispensable to prove everything from past centuries: the Holy Spirit even today assists the Church and by ways unknown to us directs its attention to a better understanding of what He Himself has spoken through the prophets. |
| **6. Si revelata est essentia metaphysica alicuius rei, revelatæ sunt etiam eius proprietates metaphysicæ, non autem eius proprietates etiam physicæ; si revelata est essentia in suo statu connaturali, revelatæ sunt proprietates connaturales; si revelata est essentia ut in statu perfecto, revelatæ sunt etiam omnes perfectiones accidentales.** | | **6. If the metaphysical essence of something has been revealed, its metaphysical properties have also been revealed, but not its physical properties as well; if the essence has been revealed in its connatural state, the connatural properties have been revealed; if the essence has been revealed as in a perfect state, all accidental perfections have also been revealed.** |
| Ita de Christo revelata est essentia humana metaphysice spectata et in statu perfecto, non autem in statu suo connaturali; ex hac triplici consideratione S. Thomas construit theses de proprietatibus illius naturæ humanæ. In Eucharistia revelata est præsentia Christi, sed non in statu connaturali quia non occupat locum. | | Thus concerning Christ, the human essence was revealed as considered metaphysically and in a perfect state, but not in its connatural state; from this threefold consideration St. Thomas constructs theses concerning the properties of that human nature. In the Eucharist, the presence of Christ was revealed, but not in a connatural state because He does not occupy a place. |
| Revelatum est quod Maria sit Mater Dei, sed non modo naturali quia *ex Spiritu Sancto*: esse Matrem et esse Matrem modo naturali realiter distinguuntur. | | It was revealed that Mary is the Mother of God, but not in a natural mode because *by the Holy Spirit*: to be Mother and to be Mother in a natural mode are really distinguished. |
| Resumo dando exempla: | | I summarize by giving examples: |
| a)\ (i) "Verbum caro factum est" (*formaliter explicite revelatum*). | | a)\ (i) "The Word was made flesh" (*formally explicitly revealed*). |
| (ii) Verbum personaliter seu hypostatice naturæ humanæ unitum est (*implicite revelatum*). | | (ii) The Word is personally or hypostatically united to human nature (*implicitly revealed*). |
| (iii) Ergo conceptus personæ in genere aliquomodo distinguitur a conceptu naturæ (*theologice certum*). | | (iii) Therefore the concept of person in general is in some way distinguished from the concept of nature (*theologically certain*). |
| b)\(i) "Qui vero non crediderit condemnabitur". | | b)\(i) "But he who does not believe will be condemned." |
| (ii) Fides necessaria et irrevocabilis (*implicite revelatum*). | | (ii) Faith necessary and irrevocable (*implicitly revealed*). |
| (iii) Ergo requiritur prævia certitudo facti Revelationis (*theologice certum*). | | (iii) Therefore prior certitude of the fact of Revelation is required (*theologically certain*). |
| c)\ (i) "Erant nudi et non erubescebant". | | c)\ (i) "They were naked and were not ashamed." |
| (ii) Non habebant concupiscentiam (*implicite revelatum*). | | (ii) They did not have concupiscence (*implicitly revealed*). |
| (iii) Ergo integritas est donum indebitum, quia per peccatum concupiscentia venit et tamen natura non est corrupta. | | (iii) Therefore integrity is an unowed gift, because through sin concupiscence came and yet nature is not corrupted. |
| d)\ (i) "Hoc est corpus meum". | | d)\ (i) "This is my body." |
| (ii) Transubstantiatio. | | (ii) Transubstantiation. |
| (iii) Ergo manent accidentia. | | (iii) Therefore the accidents remain. |
| e)\ (i) "Ego rogavi pro te ut non deficiat fides tua". | | e)\ (i) "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not". |
| (ii) Ergo Petrus est infallibilis. | | (ii) Therefore Peter is infallible. |
| (iii) Ergo est infallibilis etiam in facto dogmatico. | | (iii) Therefore he is infallible also in dogmatic fact. |
| f)\ (i) Pater Deus, Filius Deus, Spiritus Sanctus Deus. | | f)\ (i) The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God. |
| (ii) Ergo sunt consubstantiales. | | (ii) Therefore they are consubstantial. |
| (iii) Ergo est distinctio saltem rationis inter naturam et personam in genere. | | (iii) Therefore there is at least a rational distinction between nature and person in general. |
| **7. Etiam ex praxi Ecclesiæ, scilicet ex iure canonico, ex vita liturgica, ascetica, mystica Ecclesiæ sicut possunt probari quædam quæ sunt dogmata, ita possunt etiam *quædam quæ sunt doctrina catholica vel theologice certa* cum illis coniuncta.** | | **7. Also from the practice of the Church, namely from canon law, from the liturgical, ascetical, and mystical life of the Church, just as certain matters which are dogmas can be proven, so also *certain matters which are Catholic doctrine or theologically certain* connected with them can be proven.** |
| Præsertim circa vitam mysticam et asceticam sunt multa documenta doctrinalia sive positiva sive negativa quæ statuunt doctrinam vel damnant errores de vita spirituali (Dz. 1221 sq.). | | Especially concerning the mystical and ascetical life, there are many doctrinal documents both positive and negative which establish doctrine or condemn errors concerning the spiritual life (Denzinger 1221 ff.). |
| Sunt etiam documenta practica: | | There are also practical documents: |
| a)\ in legibus ecclesiasticis spectantibus varios status qui perfectionem vel postulant vel assequi conantur, ut status ecclesiasticus et religiosus: ex quibus elucet quænam sit mens Ecclesiæ de mediis aptis ad perfectionem obtinendam et de periculis cavendis in eius studio; hæc omnia possunt dici doctrina catholica vel theologica certa. | | a)\ in ecclesiastical laws pertaining to various states which either require perfection or strive to attain it, such as the ecclesiastical and religious state: from which is made clear what the mind of the Church is concerning the means suitable for obtaining perfection and concerning the dangers to be avoided in its pursuit; all these matters can be called Catholic doctrine or theologically certain. |
| In hoc puncto hodie sæpe auditur: quid faciunt v.g. illæ moniales quæ numquam exeunt ? Cur non exeunt ad faciendam actionem catholicam? *Respondeo* quod faciunt sacrificium suæ vitæ, quod est maximum quod potest fieri in hoc mundo pro actione catholica. | | On this point today one frequently hears: what are they doing, for example, those nuns who never go out? Why do they not go out to engage in Catholic action? *I respond* that they make a sacrifice of their life, which is the greatest thing that can be done in this world for Catholic action. |
| Si ita putavisset S. Theresia ab Infante Iesu, hodie non haberemus in Ecclesia tale prodigium sanctitatis. Sed neque ipse Christus ita putavit: mansit per 30 annos in vita fabri. Cur potius non exivit ad faciendam actionem catholicam ? Quæ, ut patet, est nimis stulta interrogatio. | | If Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus had thought thus, today we would not have in the Church such a prodigy of sanctity. But neither did Christ himself think thus: he remained for 30 years in the life of a craftsman. Why rather did he not go out to engage in Catholic action? Which, as is evident, is an exceedingly foolish question. |
| b)\ quando approbat ordines religiosos Ecclesia authentice declarat talem formam vitæ esse medium aptum ad sectandam perfectionem: unde quod regula S. Francisci vel S. Dominici vel S. Ignatii sit regula apta etiam hodie si Ecclesia non putat esse mutandam, est doctrina catholica vel theologice certum. Non loquor, ut patet, de singulis regulis in minimis. | | b)\ when the Church approves religious orders, she authentically declares that such a form of life is a suitable means for pursuing perfection: whence the fact that the rule of Saint Francis or Saint Dominic or Saint Ignatius is a rule suitable even today if the Church does not judge it ought to be changed, is Catholic doctrine or theologically certain. I do not speak, as is evident, of individual rules in minor matters. |
| Etiam hic auditur aliquando: sunt multa reformanda, sunt res veteres, res mediævales. | | Here too one sometimes hears: there are many things to be reformed, these are old things, medieval things. |
| Etiam ego puto quod multa sint melius adaptanda exigentiis modernis et temporibus mutatis, sed ista adaptatio facienda est a Pontifice et ab episcopis. At initiativa potest esse a privatis ? | | I too think that many things ought to be better adapted to modern requirements and changed times, but this adaptation must be made by the Pontiff and by the bishops. But can the initiative come from private persons? |
| Concedo, sed initiativa quæ fundetur in discretione, in modestia, in patientia, in humilitate. | | I grant it, but an initiative which is founded on discretion, on modesty, on patience, on humility. |
| c)\ in canonizatione sanctorum est doctrina catholica vel theologice certum quod vita sancti sit eximium exemplar vitæ christianæ: sancitur utique complexus generalis vitæ servi Dei, non autem valor singulorum actuum et multo minus imitabilitas eorundem seu aptitudo ut imitentur ab omnibus. Hoc non sancitur. Unde non ex eo quod aliquid est factum vel dictum ab aliquo sancto, ista potest esse unica ratio cur possit fieri ab omnibus. | | c)\ in the canonization of saints it is Catholic doctrine, or theologically certain, that the life of the saint be an outstanding exemplar of Christian life: what is sanctioned is indeed the general complex of the life of the Servant of God, but not the value of individual acts and much less their imitability or aptitude to be imitated by all. This is not sanctioned. Whence it does not follow that because something was done or said by some saint, this alone can be the reason why it may be done by all. |
| Ita S. Paulus restitit in faciem Petri quia reprehensibilis erat: et tamen esset nimis periculosum velle illum imitari in hoc puncto. | | Thus St. Paul resisted Peter to his face because he was to be blamed: and yet it would be exceedingly dangerous to wish to imitate him in this point. |
| **8. Qui negat propositionem vere theologice certam et sciat esse propositionem theologice certam committit peccatum grave.** | | **8. Whoever denies a proposition that is truly theologically certain and knows it to be a theologically certain proposition commits a grave sin.** |
| Ista culpa est suo modo contra fidem propter connexionem quam conclusio theologica vel factum dogmaticum habet cum fide. | | This fault is in its own way against the faith by reason of the connection which a theological conclusion or dogmatic fact has with the faith. |
