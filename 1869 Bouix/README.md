## Caput XIII: An et quatenus sit de jure divino et de fide, Romanum Pontificem esse successorem sancti Petri in primatu auctoritatis

### **§ 3.** — *Whether it is of the faith that such a one (for example Pius IX) is the Supreme Pontiff.*

There exists among Catholic doctors some controversy concerning this matter; but it turns only upon the different manner of understanding and explaining the requisite conditions in order that any proposition may be and ought to be called *of the faith*. For some deny that this proposition, "Pius IX is the Supreme Pontiff," is *of the faith*, on the ground that that proposition was not expressly revealed by Christ. Others hold the contrary, relying on this reasoning: It was revealed, and is **of the faith, that anyone canonically elected as the successor of Peter is the Supreme Pontiff**; on the other hand, that Pius IX was canonically elected is established by the testimony of the Church, **which recognized Pius IX as canonically elected, and which cannot err in recognizing her true head**. Therefore, they say, once such recognition has been posited, **it is simply *of the faith* that Pius IX is the Supreme Pontiff**, that is to say, the successor of Peter in the primacy.

In what sense the said proposition is *of the faith*, and in what sense it is not *of the faith*, can be explained and proven thus:

1°\ Immediately upon its becoming known that someone has been canonically elected as Roman Pontiff (and this becomes known from the fact that Catholic bishops recognize the election as canonical), **it becomes certain by this very fact that the one elected must be regarded as the Roman Pontiff, the successor of Peter, and the Vicar of Christ, and that all manner of obedience is owed to him by all persons**. On this point the advocates of both opinions set forth above are in agreement, nor does any doubt exist among Catholics concerning this matter.

2°\ This proposition, "Pius IX is the Roman Pontiff," was not immediately and formally expressed and revealed by Christ. Therefore, it is not *de fide* in the sense that it was expressly and formally revealed.

3° Nevertheless, **it is *de fide* in an absolute sense**. For **it is a matter of faith that whosoever is canonically elected as Roman Pontiff is the successor of Saint Peter, and by this very fact the head of the entire Church and its supreme ruler, or Supreme Pontiff**. On the other hand, it is likewise **de fide that the Church cannot err in recognizing its head**; and consequently it is absolutely certain that he whom the Church recognizes as such has been canonically elected. Since, therefore, the Church recognizes Pius IX as Roman Pontiff, it is certain—even with supernatural certitude—that he was canonically elected. Therefore this proposition, *Pius IX is the Supreme Pontiff*, is a particular proposition which is contained in this universal proposition: *whosoever is canonically elected is the Supreme Pontiff*. [...] Now the universal proposition, *whosoever is canonically elected is the Supreme Pontiff*, is absolutely *de fide*. On the other hand, when any universal proposition is *de fide*, all particular propositions contained in it are at the same time and by this very fact *de fide*. Thus, for example, because this universal proposition is *de fide*—all men (except the Most Blessed Virgin) have contracted original sin—the particular propositions are also *de fide*: Caesar contracted original sin, Cicero contracted original sin, etc. **Therefore the proposition *Pius IX is the Supreme Pontiff* is absolutely *de fide***, inasmuch as it is a particular proposition certainly contained in the universal proposition *de fide*, namely in this one: *Everyone canonically elected is the Supreme Pontiff and the successor of Peter in the primacy*.

The same [point] can be proven otherwise thus: just as *de fide* is whatever the Council of Trent defined, so too is it *de fide* that this council was ecumenical. For if its ecumenicity were not *de fide*, by that very fact neither would its infallibility in defining be *de fide*. Consequently, what it defined would not be infallibly true, and a fortiori would not be *de fide*. Therefore, **the ecumenicity of the Council of Trent is *de fide* and must be believed**. Nevertheless, it was not expressly and formally revealed by Christ. But on the one hand it is *de fide* that any council clothed with the requisite conditions is ecumenical and infallible; and on the other hand it is certain that those conditions were not lacking to the Council of Trent, because the Supreme Pontiff or the Church acknowledged them, **nor can the Supreme Pontiff or the Church err in judging which councils have possessed the conditions of ecumenicity and infallibility**. Therefore, just as the ecumenicity of the Council of Trent is *de fide* and must be believed from the fact that the Supreme Pontiff or the Church acknowledged it, **so too is it *de fide* and must be believed that Pius IX is the Supreme Pontiff and true successor of Peter, from the fact that the Church acknowledged him as canonically elected.**

4°\ If anyone, however, should be unwilling to admit the proposition *Pius IX is the Supreme Pontiff* as formally *of the faith*, on the ground that he understands by this name only propositions expressly and formally revealed by Christ, his opinion seems to be one of those views which the Church has thus far permitted to the free disputation of the schools. **But he is bound at least to admit the said proposition as a theological conclusion absolutely certain, and also pertaining implicitly to the faith, and to which internal assent is also owed under grave sin against the faith and to the detriment of salvation.**
