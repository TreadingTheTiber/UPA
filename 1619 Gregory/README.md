## Disputatio I, Quaestio I, De Obiecto Fidei, Punct. VII, Quaestio V, Sectio 37

[...]

**We therefore affirm that for someone to be the successor of Blessed Peter is nothing other than for him to be received by the Church in the place of Blessed Peter in a legitimate manner**, and as it were offered to Christ, so that He may confer upon him the supreme authority which Peter had, that is, so that He may establish by a certain law that He will concur with him by a certain particular assistance in rightly establishing those things in doctrine and morals which pertain to the good estate of the Church. For this is what it means for someone to have that supreme power and primacy in the Church which Peter had. **Moreover, the legitimate mode of receiving someone into the place of Peter is entirely that which the Church herself prescribes and employs according to the circumstances of each time and all other conditions.**

[...]

For from these and similar passages it is understood that the care and charity of Christ toward His spouse the Church is perpetually of such a nature as is most suitably and fittingly accommodated to human nature for preserving the state of the Church. Now it can scarcely be doubted that, considering the nature and condition of men, it is expedient that he who is to govern the universal Church with authority received from Christ should be received and approved by that same Church for this office. Therefore, since Christ the Lord willed that there be perpetually in the Church successors of Peter, to whom He might assign the supreme authority on earth which He had conferred upon Peter, **it was necessary that He grant this to His Church: that she herself might choose for such a Pastor the one whom, according to the circumstances of the times, she judged to be most suitable for this office.** This very point is confirmed by the perpetual custom of the Church concerning succession in the see both of Peter and of the other Bishops. **For he has always been held to be the legitimate successor of any Bishop whom the Church has received in his place in that form and manner which, according to the circumstances, has been deemed most fitting in each particular place.**

[...]

## §. 39: *Refutation of the arguments by which Sectarians contend that the Roman Pontiff is not the successor of the blessed Peter.*

[...]

**THE THIRD argument** is properly against this very point which we were now setting forth, namely that those Roman Pontiffs who have preceded up to the present one have been legitimately received by the Church. For from the time of Urban VI, who was elected in the month of April in the year 1378 after the death of Gregory XI, up to the present Pontiff, none appears to have succeeded legitimately. For, as may be seen in Saint Antoninus in the third part of his history, title 22, chapter 2, and at the beginning of the Council of Constance, in that same year 1378 in the month of July, certain of the Cardinals, because they could not bear the difficult character of the elected Pontiff, departed from Rome, and in the following month of September elected another Pontiff, who was named Clement VII. Moreover, Urban remained in Rome, Clement in Avignon. And each had his own adherents. This schism continued with such unbroken succession of each Pontiff and of the Cardinals created by them, until the year 1417, when on the eleventh day of the month of November Martin V was elected, such that it could not be sufficiently discerned which of them was the true Pontiff. [...] And so neither the preceding Pontiffs, nor Martin V himself, and consequently neither the other subsequent Pontiffs who thereafter succeeded Martin, appear to have been received by the Church in a legitimate manner.

**I RESPOND** that, during that period which elapsed from Urban VI up to Martin V, those Pontiffs can indeed be considered to have been legitimately received who were received in succession to the position of this Urban; whereas the others were schismatics. For concerning the election of Urban himself, there seems no reason to doubt that it was legitimate. [...] **But whether these or those, during that schism, were legitimate Pontiffs, or whether none of those who were elected in the schism [were legitimate], but rather the see was then, as it were, vacant—this indeed makes no difference, provided it is established that Martin V himself was at length received in the later Council of Constance in a legitimate manner** in the place of that Urban, and of [his] predecessors, and thus also in the place of St. Peter himself.

That this is indeed the case, we prove in this manner: for, as was stated above in §36, **the legitimate mode of receiving someone as Peter's successor is rather that which the Church prescribes according to the circumstances of the times and other conditions, and which she judges to be correct**; whether that mode be prescribed by the Pontiff himself (in whom, as in the head, resides the primary authority of the Church, and therefore also the right of establishing the mode in the election of a Pontiff), or whether it be prescribed by the Church decreeing in Council or otherwise, when the Apostolic See is indeed vacant, or when its possession is not entirely certain, and grave circumstances demand some extraordinary mode of election; as can be understood from what Torquemada learnedly wrote in book 4 of *De Ecclesia*, chapter 10, concerning the ten ways of resolving schisms in papal elections. **For Christ never abandons His Church, so that in every case she may emerge from the difficulties of schisms, receiving an undoubted and certain Pontiff peacefully and without scandal in the place of St. Peter.**

[...]

From which it is understood how shamefully Wycliffe, whom other heretics also follow, erred when in his ninth condemned proposition at the Council of Constance he asserted that from the time of Urban VI no one should be received as Pontiff, but rather one should live according to one's own laws in the manner of the Greeks. **These men err most shamefully: because there was, and always will be, a way and method in the Church of Christ whereby, once schism has been settled, one unique, true, and undoubted Pontiff is acknowledged by all.**

[...]

**A FOURTH argument** can be made against what has now been stated, namely, that he is the legitimate successor of Peter whom the Church receives in the manner which it judges most fitting. **For he who is the legitimate successor of Peter certainly and infallibly receives from Christ the Lord supreme power on earth**, such as Peter had, as has been proven above. But not always does he who is received by the Church in a legitimate manner in the place of Peter receive that power from Christ the Lord: Therefore, he is not immediately the legitimate successor of Peter who is received by the Church in a legitimate manner. This is evident in the case where a woman would be elected through error [...]. Moreover, the same thing is evident if through error some baptized unbeliever were elected. For such a person would not truly receive from Christ the primary power, nor would he truly be Pontiff, as Turrecremata [Juan de Torquemada] sets forth from the common opinion of the orthodox, book 4 *de Ecclesia*, part 2, chapter 20.

**I RESPOND.** What has been said—namely, that he is the legitimate successor of blessed Peter, and thus receives the primary authority from Christ, whom the Church receives in the place of blessed Peter in a legitimate manner—**this is not to be understood otherwise than on the presupposition that the Church elects and receives in a legitimate manner someone who is otherwise capable of the pontificate.** But a woman and an infidel are minimally capable of the pontificate. Wherefore this argument does not overthrow those things which have been said.

But hence another difficulty arises in turn, concerning which it is customarily treated not unprofitably by Catholic Theologians in the schools. **For if those cases in which persons incapable of the Pontificate are elected are possible, it follows that we cannot be entirely certain whether this or that person elected is the true Pontiff.** For although we may be altogether certain that the true Church, in a suitable manner, both on the part of the electors and on the part of the manner of electing, has legitimately received this or that person: yet we could doubt whether he has been baptized, and thus whether he is capable of the Pontificate. And so neither shall we be able to be altogether certain concerning those things which he as Pontiff has defined as pertaining to the faith. **And the matter will come to the same thing as if it were permitted to doubt whether God has willed that there be any successor of Peter at all in the Church perpetually, who is the infallible rule of faith and morals.**

To resolve this difficulty, I would willingly reply with that alone which many learned and pious men rightly believe, and which I myself am persuaded of: **namely, that it will never come to pass that an incapable person be elected; with God easily preventing this (as He can), in order to avert danger from His Church.** Nor do I judge that this has ever truly happened, or that it can happen according to the ordinary law: since a decree of divine providence of this kind clearly stands in the way. But because even grave Doctors admit such a case as possible, it must consequently be conceded by them that not from this fact alone—that someone has been elected by the Church to the place of Saint Peter—is it certain with infallible faith that he is the true Pontiff; since one incapable of that office could be elected, as they admit. **However, that inconvenience which was objected does not follow from this**; namely, that it be necessary to doubt the certitude of the definitions or decrees of an elected Pontiff. This inconvenience, I say, does not follow, and **we demonstrate this by a twofold argument.**

**FIRST**, because **it is established with certain faith as firm and ratified that whatever he who is regarded by all the faithful as Pastor of the universal Church establishes concerning the universal Church is firm and ratified; for the whole Church, which cannot be deceived, is bound to receive that**, as will be proven shortly hereafter. Moreover, he who has been legitimately received by the Church in the place of Saint Peter is regarded by all the faithful as the universal Pastor: Therefore, **if he should decree anything with respect to the universal Church, no one can doubt that it is ratified and firm**: whether indeed he decrees it infallibly as the true Pontiff, whose ministry God uses as an instrument according to a certain and ordinary law in governing the Church, or whether it be only that God, in a particular case, does not permit him to err and thereby lead into error the universal Church, to which God has promised He will never be wanting.

**THE SECOND reason** why that inconvenience which was objected does not follow is this: **because as soon as he who has been elected Pontiff establishes something concerning faith or morals that pertains to the universal Church, by that very fact it is certain to us as a matter of faith that he is a legitimate Pontiff**, who has indeed received from God that primary power of jurisdiction. But you may ask: whence is this certitude of faith then drawn? I answer: **from two propositions of faith**, in this manner: **He whom Christ the Lord wishes to be heard by the universal Church in those matters which pertain either to faith or to morals is the true and legitimate pastor of the universal Church. But when a Pontiff elected by the Church in a legitimate manner establishes something pertaining to the universal Church in matters of faith or morals, Christ the Lord wishes him to be heard by the universal Church: Therefore, he is the true Pastor of the universal Church.**

The prior proposition is evident from those testimonies of Scripture by which above in §. 27 we proved that Christ the Lord willed that the entire edifice of the Church should rise upon Peter specifically and his successors. For He says in Matthew 16: *"Upon thee I will build my Church."* And in John 21: *"Feed (thou, Peter) my sheep."* And in Luke 22: *"Thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren."*

Now is proved that other latter proposition: namely, that Christ wills that he who has been legitimately elected by the Church as Pontiff should be heard by the universal Church in matters of faith and morals. **For since in Scripture a precept is given to subjects, in Hebrews 13, that they should obey their Superiors, the discourse is entirely about those Superiors whom the subjects acknowledge to be their Superiors, and regard as such; otherwise that precept would be given utterly in vain. Wherefore i0t is certain from the faith that Christ wills that the universal Church should hear him teaching concerning matters of faith and morals whom she acknowledges to be her Pastor.** But she entirely acknowledges him to be her Pastor whom she herself has legitimately elected and received. Him, therefore, by Christ's will she is bound to hear. Therefore, that latter proposition is also certain from the faith. **And thus it is evident that the conclusion also, which we have deduced from both propositions, is certain from the faith: namely, that he who has been legitimately elected as Pontiff, and who afterwards defines something for the universal Church, is truly Pontiff; and consequently there is no reason whatsoever to doubt the certainty of his decrees.**

From these matters it follows that, **if by chance someone incapable of this authority should be elected to the Pontificate (which I minimally fear will happen), nevertheless it would never come to pass that he would decree anything affecting the universal Church**, but either he would depart from life before it came to that point, or certainly his defect and incapacity would be detected by Divine Providence. Nor indeed would this be any miracle, but something entirely consequent from that ordinary law of Christ, by which He willed to govern His universal Church not through the ministry of any other individual man, except the legitimate Pastor.

[...]

But **SOMEONE WILL ASK** here: of what kind ought that thing to be, pertaining to the universal Church, which when the Pontiff establishes it, he is most certainly understood according to faith to be the true Pontiff? For if it is necessary that he define something concerning the faith; since definitions of this kind are made by few Pontiffs and rarely; it will also rarely be established from faith that someone is a true Pontiff.

**I RESPOND** first, that as long as the Pontiff indeed establishes nothing with regard to the universal Church, **little or almost no danger is imminent if for a long time or even not at all it were established from faith that he is the true Pontiff, but only with moral certainty.** For it is something more for the Apostolic See to be entirely vacant than for it not to be entirely established from faith whether he who presides in it presides legitimately and truly. And yet the Apostolic See is sometimes vacant for some time without great inconvenience to the Church. Therefore it will be less of an inconvenience if he who presides in it is considered to preside rightly with only moral certainty, but not with infallible faith.

Next, we say that **not only from a definition of faith, but also from some institution concerning morals pertaining to the universal Church** (such as are frequently made by the Pontiffs), **it can be gathered as a matter of faith that someone is the true Pontiff.** Indeed, even from the dispensation of the Treasury of the Church through a general indulgence or jubilee. For by these means also Christ provides for His Church through the ministry of no other than the true Pastor. Wherefore it happens not so rarely that the true Pontiff is established as certain through faith.

[...]

**Three things, therefore, have been proven and defended by us thus far, from which we most certainly conclude that the Roman Pontiff is endowed with supreme authority in the Church to determine infallibly concerning matters of faith and morals. FIRST, that such authority was bestowed upon Saint Peter by Christ. SECOND, that this authority was bestowed by Christ not upon Peter alone, but also upon his legitimate successors until the end of the age. THIRD, that the Roman Pontiffs are altogether the legitimate successors of Saint Peter in this respect.** Wherefore it undoubtedly remains that the Roman Pontiff, existing for the time being, is he to whom as successor of Saint Peter the care of the universal Church, with respect to what pertains to faith and morals, has been committed, and in whom accordingly resides the authority to decide concerning all questions of faith.
