If it remains doubtful in the external forum whether the election is valid, does not the Pope who emerges from this election himself become doubtful? And is this not a case for convening a council to deliver the Church from this uncertainty?

We answer, no:

Canonically, a Pope resulting from a dubious election is dubious when the doubt concerns the very substance of the election regarding its essential conditions, as they are *defined* by natural law or positive law. For example, if there had been serious reasons to believe that the election had been forced, or that the elect had not received two-thirds of the votes. On the observance of these conditions depends *certainly* the validity and consequently the reality of the election. If opposing cardinals seriously contest the freedom of electoral operations, or the number of votes obtained, etc., then the principle *factum non supponitur sed probatur* applies, the fact of a free and regular election must be established. And one finds for recourse to a council an incontestable principle of prosecution in certain laws. But here the doubt concerns this circumstance of simony, not as to the fact, but insofar as it may vitiate the election and render it null. The doubt is a doubt of law. In this case, in the absence of a positive decree resolving the question, one must govern one's conduct by this principle: *Lex dubia, lex nulla*. The elect is in possession of his election through the fulfillment of the *certain* conditions necessarily required; it is not the infraction *of a doubtful law* that can dispossess him of it. It is not *a doubtful law*, and thereby of no effect, that can serve as a foundation to require the declaration of nullity, and, consequently, to justify an act as serious as calling into question the reality of pontifical power in the holder of the Primacy, at the risk of causing disorder in the Church.

It is understandable, therefore, that in practice, a Pope emerging from a notoriously simoniacal election was or should be considered a true Pope, at least *juridically*.

Was he *really* so? — Nothing less certain.

It is manifest, indeed, that if such an election is null in itself, as one may theologically believe, the absence of a positive decree explaining divine law and allowing for the canonical pursuit of its invalidity would not suffice to validate it.

**But it remains established that if the elect did not emerge as Pope from the operations of the Conclave, he could become one. How? — Through the acceptance of the Church.**

**It must be noted, indeed, that the initial right of election originally belongs to Christian society. The Sovereign Pontiffs were able to limit the use of this right, reserving its exercise to the college of cardinals, but they did not intend to extinguish it, precisely for the case where it becomes the only resource to address this distress of society. The Church, in this case, does not supply jurisdiction, as some theologians wrongly say; it supplies the election through the oath of obedience given by the different parts of Christendom [FN 20].**

**Alexander VI had received these oaths of obedience, quite hesitant obedience it is true, not to say somewhat bargained for, always ready to withdraw itself, yet secure enough that Charles VIII, for example, resisted the suggestions of the cardinals and considered himself fortunate to be admitted to make his three reverences to Alexander VI, before kissing his feet.**

We do not therefore think that the mere fact of simony, even as well established as was the shameful bargain to which Rodrigue Borgia owed his elevation, could justify Savonarola's initiative to have a council assembled. The juridical doubt was insufficient at the very moment of the election, and it even lost its value once the elect had been recognized by the Church.

In this case, the good faith of the Friar might well not be in question, his intimate and speculative conviction of the nullity of the election on these theological grounds, yet his conduct would nonetheless remain subject to criticism from the perspective of Christian prudence as well as from the standpoint of canon law. It would be easy to find a thousand excuses for him, as one grants to Joseph de Maistre, hardly suspect of sympathy for conciliar supremacy and who nevertheless wrote in his book *On the Pope*: "When all-powerful courtesans, monsters of crime and wickedness, taking advantage of public disorders, had seized power, disposed of everything in Rome, and placed on the throne of Saint Peter, by the most culpable means, either their sons or their lovers, I *expressly deny that these men were Popes*. Anyone who would undertake to prove the contrary proposition *would certainly find himself greatly hindered*." De Maistre adds in a footnote that he could defend or explain this paragraph, but that he prefers to relinquish it.

**[FN 20] This principle applies even after the Bull of Julius II, in the case where the secret of the simoniacal transaction would be so well kept that one could not juridically prove it.**
