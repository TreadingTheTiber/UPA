## Disputatio 4. De primario Ecclesia Capite. Dubium 6

[...]

*Whether it is a matter of Faith that this Pope, for example Alexander VII, is the legitimate successor of Peter? And consequently, whether it is also a matter of Faith that this particular Council, for example the Council of Trent, is legitimate and endowed with the infallible assistance of the Holy Spirit in treating matters of Faith, once the Pope and Council have been recognized as legitimate?*

[...] This difficulty is very celebrated and of the highest importance. For the negative opinion, Father Oviedo cites Torquemada, Cajetan, Báñez, Vásquez, Torres, and Gaspar Hurtado, who was summoned to Rome by Clement VIII. [...] For the affirmative position, there stand Father Suárez, Tanner, Hurtado, Cardinal Lugo, Palao, and many others.

### RESOLUTION I.

**I say first: The affirmative opinion regarding the first part is to me most certain.**

It is proved first thus: **It is of the faith that he is the legitimate successor of Peter whom Christ commands us to obey in matters pertaining to faith and morals.** But it is established that Christ commands us and the universal Church to obey in these matters the Pope legitimately elected and recognized as such; therefore, etc. The major premise is proved from the Scriptures, by which Christ conferred upon Peter and his successors the power of feeding the sheep in faith and morals. The minor premise is proved because **nothing is more certain than that we must obey our Superiors**, such as are those legitimately elected as Pope and recognized as such.

It is proved secondly, because **otherwise it would not even be a matter of faith that Innocent X was the legitimate successor of Peter**, and thus concerning the entire series of Pontiffs going back in time, and **in this way all certainty of the true Church would collapse**; and heretics would be confirmed in their errors; and the legitimate Vicar of Christ and successor of Saint Peter would not be known to us with certainty in the particular case: whence **the way to the Judge of controversies would be closed**, but opened to heretics—indeed, even to Catholics—to deny everything except Scripture. To obviate these absurdities, Martin V, by a special Bull at the Council of Constance, decreed that **heretics returning to the Church should believe that the Pope who shall be for the time being, his name being expressly stated, canonically elected, is the successor of Peter and possesses supreme power in the Church**.

It is confirmed: **from the fact that the universal Church receives this Scripture as true and legitimate, it is of the faith that it is such; therefore, similarly, from the fact that the Church acknowledges this particular Pope as legitimate, it is of the faith that he is such**—even before he defines anything *ex cathedra*—as is clearly gathered from the Councils. [...] Note that, according to the testimony of Diana, tome 11, **Clement VIII summoned certain doctors of the opposite opinion to Rome and imprisoned them**.

**Objection:** These propositions—*Alexander VII is baptized; Alexander VII is canonically elected Roman Pontiff*—absolutely and simply are not propositions of the Catholic Faith. [...] Their truth is established solely by the testimony of the one baptizing, of the electors, and of others who acknowledge him as Pontiff.

[...] It does not appear why someone incapable of the pontifical dignity—for example, one not baptized, or not ordained, not male but female, etc.—cannot be assumed and presented as a legitimate Pontiff, provided that God does not permit him to define anything *ex cathedra*.

**I respond:** These propositions are not absolutely and simply matters of Catholic Faith *per se* and directly—I grant; **indirectly and with respect to the special assistance of God, which God has promised to His Church, concerning not permitting His whole Church to err in recognizing someone as the legitimate successor of Peter who is not such**—I deny the assumption. [...] **Otherwise he would not be the legitimate successor of Peter; whence those propositions ought to be certain.**

[...] I think it follows that it is established only by moral evidence that he is the Supreme Pontiff [...] and that this suffices for the certitude of decrees of Faith; **which I do not approve, lest it should consequently be necessary to admit that decrees of Faith are only morally certain** [...] and consequently that doubt can be raised concerning them—**which I would not dare to assert**.

[...] **The testimony of the whole Church does not concur** in the approval of [private] consecrations [...] **as it does in the approval of the Pontiff as the legitimate Successor of Peter**: for the one is not as morally evident as the other; **nor has a special assistance been promised by God** to prevent false private claims, **as assistance has been promised to prevent a pontiff not legitimately elected, not baptized, etc., from being proposed by the whole Church** as legitimately elected and a legitimate pontiff, **so that all error may be removed from the whole Church**.

I respond by denying the assumption: because either such a person would have the special assistance of the Holy Spirit promised [...] or not? If the first; **it would have to be said that a defect of Baptism, of Orders, and of sex renders no one incapable of the Papacy**—the opposite of which the argument supposes. If the second; **the entire Church would err concerning the legitimate successor of Peter, the living rule of Faith and morals, etc., which is heretical**. [...] There would always remain doubt about the truthfulness of the one proposing matters of Faith and morals [...] **From this it would follow that the truth of matters proposed by the first living rule would be doubtful, which is also heretical**: whence this inference is valid: **We are bound by certain faith to believe that which the first living rule proposes as to be believed: therefore also that this particular man is the first living rule**.

[...] **God promised that the whole Church would not fail, would not err**; but the entire Church is not bound to believe a Parish Priest, but only this or that particular parishioner, who can err; **not so the entire Church**.

### RESOLUTION II.

**I say secondly that the affirmative opinion concerning the second part is also most certain to me.**

Proof: because **there is no legitimate Council unless it be confirmed by the Pontiff**; but **the Pontiff's confirmation in matters of faith and morals is certain by divine faith**: therefore [...] **otherwise nothing defined in Trent and other Councils would have to be believed by Divine Faith**.
