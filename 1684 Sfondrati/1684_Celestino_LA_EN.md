| XVII. *Non obstat 17*. Fide tantum humana constare hunc in individuo hominem, v. g. Innocentium XI. esse legitimum verumque Pontificem, ac in terris Christi Vicarium; at fides humana errori subest, fieri que potest, non esse legitimum Pontificem: quid si enim invalide electus? quid si non rite baptizatus? aut unde nobis constat rite Baptizatum, electumque esse, nisi fide humana, quae falli potest? Sic Ioannes VIII. sic Formosus veri Pontifices credebantur, & tamen eventus docuit, illum feminam fuisse, istum non verum sed imaginarium Papam, & cuius acta a Stephano VI. omnia rescissa sunt. Si ergo fide divina & certa Innocentium Pontificem esse non constat; non etiam certa divinaque fide constabit, quae ab illo decernuntur, certa esse, & ad dogma, si hoc declaret, spectare. | | XVII.\ *Objection 17*. It is established by merely human faith that this particular individual, e.g., Innocent XI, is the legitimate and true Pontiff, and the Vicar of Christ on earth; but human faith is subject to error, and it is possible that he might not be the legitimate Pontiff. What if he was invalidly elected? What if he was not properly baptized? Or how is it established for us that he was properly baptized and elected, except by human faith, which can be deceived? Thus John VIII and Formosus were believed to be true Pontiffs, and yet events taught that the former was a woman, and the latter not a true but an imaginary Pope, whose acts were all rescinded by Stephen VI. If, therefore, it is not established by divine and certain faith that Innocent is Pontiff, it will also not be established by certain and divine faith that what is decreed by him is certain and pertains to dogma, should he declare this. |
| Respondeo. Hanc objectionem nimium sibi sumere, & si quid probet, non in Pontifices tantum, sed in omnia Concilia, in totam Ecclesiam, & intima fidei Catholicae viscera grassari: si enim certa, indubiaque fide non constat Innocentium XI. legitimum Papam esse: ergo nec Innocentium X. nec Clementem IX. nec Alexandrum VII. nec Leonem, nec Agathonem, nec Sylvestrum: in omnibus enim aut nulla subest dubitandi ratio, aut eadem. Si ergo Pontifices, & ab illis definita dubia sunt; ergo etiam quae a Conciliis, nam haec a Pontifice confirmantur, & sine Pontifice tam sunt integra, quam corpus capite suo truncum. Immo ex iisdem causis, quae tibi Pontifices, eorumque electiones dubias faciunt, ipsa etiam Concilia in dubium vocantur, quae ut sint legitima, multo pluribus, quam Pontifices opus habent: dubio vero Pontifice, dubiis Conciliis, dubiis etiam quae ab illis constituta sunt, quid superest in fide certum? frustra Ariana haeresis, frustra Nestoriana, Eutychiana, Lutherana, Calvinistica, frustra omnes haereses damnatae, nam ut tu dicis, incerti erant Papae, incerta Concilia, incerta ab utrisque decisa; quae vero incerta sunt, nec ad haeresin, nec ad fidem pertinent, ut credi necessario negasive debeant. | | I respond. This objection assumes too much, and if it proves anything, it attacks not only the Popes, but all Councils, the entire Church, and the very core of the Catholic faith. For if it cannot be established with certain and undoubted faith that Innocent XI is the legitimate Pope, then neither can it be established for Innocent X, nor Clement IX, nor Alexander VII, nor Leo, nor Agatho, nor Sylvester: for in all cases either there is no reason for doubt, or the same reason applies. If, therefore, the Popes and what they have defined are doubtful, then so too are the decrees of Councils, for these are confirmed by the Pope, and without the Pope they are as complete as a body severed from its head. Indeed, from the same causes that make the Popes and their elections doubtful for you, the Councils themselves are called into question, which to be legitimate require many more conditions than Popes do. But with a doubtful Pope, doubtful Councils, and doubtful decrees established by them, what certainty remains in the faith? In vain was the Arian heresy condemned, in vain the Nestorian, Eutychian, Lutheran, and Calvinist heresies, in vain all heresies were condemned, for as you say, the Popes were uncertain, the Councils uncertain, and uncertain were their decisions; and what is uncertain belongs neither to heresy nor to faith, such that they must necessarily be believed or denied. |
| Quod si nemo audet Concilia, quae ab Ecclesia recepta sunt, in dubium vocare, immo qui hoc agit, aeque ac qui Evangelia non recipit, haereticus est teste D. Gregorio *in c. sicut. d. 15.* idem de Pontifice Romano dicendum est, par enim, ut paulo ante notavimus, de utrisque est ratio. Et sicut ad fidem non sufficit credere aliquam in genere Ecclesiam, & non istam determinatam; aut aliquas scripturas sacras, sed non istas, quas manibus terimus; ita nec sufficit, aliquem in Ecclesia Christi Vicarium, aliquod caput visibile, aliquem Iudicem Controversiarum, sed non istum, quem Ecclesia elegit, quem Ecclesia colit, a quo leges & decreta, ac in rebus controversis sententiae procedunt. | | But if no one dares to call into question the Councils that have been received by the Church—indeed, according to St. Gregory *in c. sicut. d. 15*, whoever does this is a heretic just as one who does not accept the Gospels—the same must be said of the Roman Pontiff, for as we noted a little earlier, the reasoning is the same for both. And just as it is not sufficient for faith to believe in some Church in general but not this specific one, or in some sacred scriptures but not these that we hold in our hands, so too it is not sufficient to believe in some Vicar of Christ in the Church, some visible head, some Judge of Controversies, but not this one whom the Church has elected, whom the Church venerates, from whom laws and decrees and judgments in controversial matters proceed. |
| Quando navigabis, quando litem absolves, quando finem morbo impones, si aliquam quidem navim, aliquem iudicem, aliquem medicum velis, sed nullum certum, nullumque, quem possis digito ostendere, nec istum, nec illum admittas? sic pessime consultum Ecclesiae, pessime fidelibus, si Christus nullum illis Pontificem dedit, cum in morum, tum in fidei decretis certam fidem deberent, certamque obedientiam. Nec in Ecclesia tot retro saeculis, & haereticis toties in Romanam sedem armatis auditum aliquando est, hanc Pontificibus eorumque Decretis exceptionem oppositam esse, quod videl. non certo constaret Leonem, Sylvestrum, Damasum legitimos Papas esse: quam ti putas hoc inventum Ariani emisissent, ut Nicaeno Concilio litem inferrent, & quae illic Patres deciderant, inania redderent? sed hoc nostro saeculo, in quo tanta novarum rerum cupido est, vicimus antiquitatem, novo artificio reperto, ut Papam sine Papa, legem sine lege, sententiam sine sententia haberemus, hoc est, aliquem Papam, sed non istum, aliquem Legislatorem, sed non istum, aliquem Iudicem, sed non istum, nullumque certum; capta interim credendi faciendique quod placet libertate. | | When will you sail, when will you resolve a lawsuit, when will you put an end to a disease, if you indeed want some ship, some judge, some physician, but none certain, and none that you can point to with your finger, accepting neither this one nor that one? Similarly, the Church would be very poorly provided for, and the faithful very poorly served, if Christ had given them no Pope to whom they would owe certain faith and certain obedience, both in matters of morals and of faith. Nor has it ever been heard in the Church through so many centuries past, even with heretics so often armed against the Roman See, that this objection was raised against the Popes and their Decrees—namely, that it was not certainly established that Leo, Sylvester, or Damasus were legitimate Popes. How eagerly would the Arians have seized upon this invention, as you think it to be, to attack the Nicene Council and render void what the Fathers decided there! But in our age, in which there is such a great desire for novelty, we have surpassed antiquity, having discovered a new artifice by which we might have a Pope without a Pope, a law without a law, a judgment without a judgment—that is, some Pope, but not this one; some Lawgiver, but not this one; some Judge, but not this one; and none certain—meanwhile seizing the liberty to believe and do whatever we please. |
| Denique post Concilium Constantiense vix intelligimus, quomodo negari possit certa fide hunc in individuo Pontificem pro vero legitimoue habendum esse, *fess* enim *ult*. Martinus Papa sacro approbante Concilio, ab haereticis, qui Ecclesiae Catholicae conjungi volunt, ante omnia exigendum esse dicit: *Ut credant Papam Canonicè electum, qui pro tempore fuerit, eius nomine expresso esse successorem Petri, & supremam habere in Ecclesia potestatem*. Supponit ergo Concilium, credi posse fide divina (nec enim de alia fide quam divina haeretici sunt interrogandi) hunc numero & determinatum Pontificem legitimum esse Christi Vicarium, immo credi debere, nec enim quae credi non possunt, aut non debent, necessario credenda sunt. | | Finally, after the Council of Constance, we can scarcely understand how anyone could deny with certain faith that this individual Pope should be considered true and legitimate, for in the *final session*, Pope Martin, with the approval of the sacred Council, declares that from heretics who wish to be joined to the Catholic Church, it must be demanded before all else: *That they believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, with his name explicitly stated, is the successor of Peter, and holds supreme power in the Church*. The Council therefore supposes that one can believe with divine faith (for heretics are not to be questioned about any faith other than divine faith) that this specific and determined Pontiff is the legitimate Vicar of Christ—indeed, that one must believe it, for those things that cannot or should not be believed are not necessarily to be believed. |
| Dices: Concilium loqui de Pontifice canonice electo, at non constare canonice electum esse. | | You will say: The Council speaks of a canonically elected Pontiff, but it is not established that he has been canonically elected. |
| Respondemus: Si constare certa fide non potest Papam Canonice electum esse, cur ergo Concilium tam accurate vult haereticos de hoc interrogari? erit enim otiosa minimeque necessaria interrogatio, cum sicut constare non potest esse canonice & valide electum, ita nec legitimum Pontificem Christique Vicarium. At Papam legitime baptizatum, ordinatum, electumque esse Deus nunquam revelavit, qui ergo credi potest? Imo tunc revelavit, cum tota Ecclesia Pontificem pro legitimo habuit recepitque; vox enim & testimonium Ecclesiae, quae falli non potest, vox est & testimonium Dei: sicut enim Deus nunc verbo, nunc littera, nunc miraculis, ita vocibus & assensu Ecclesiae loquitur, iuxta illud Christi Domini pollicitum: *Non enim vos estis qui loquimini, sed spiritus Patris vestri, qui loquitur in vobis; ipse Spiritus docebit vos omnem veritatem*. | | We respond: If it cannot be established with certain faith that the Pope has been canonically elected, why then does the Council so carefully want heretics to be questioned about this? For the interrogation would be idle and wholly unnecessary, since just as it cannot be established that he was canonically and validly elected, so too he cannot be established as a legitimate Pontiff and Vicar of Christ. But God has never revealed that the Pope was legitimately baptized, ordained, and elected, so how can it be believed? Indeed, He revealed it when the whole Church accepted and received the Pontiff as legitimate; for the voice and testimony of the Church, which cannot be deceived, is the voice and testimony of God: just as God speaks now by word, now by letter, now by miracles, so He speaks through the voices and assent of the Church, according to that promise of Christ the Lord: *"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you; the Spirit himself will teach you all truth."* |
| Ad Dei ergo Providentiam curamque pertinet, ut Ecclesiam, quam voluit esse columnam & firmamentum veritatis, in re tanti momenti errare non permittat, eumque pro Pontifice colere, qui Pontifex non est; aut si permittat circa personam ipsam Pontificis errare, non permittat tamen circa auctoritatem, hoc est, putatio Pontifici eam ipsam auctoritatem potestatemque, quam vero tribuat, quemadmodum leges humanae id ipsum in putatirio iudice, teste, & matrimonio statuunt *in l. Barbarinus. de off. Praet. l. 3. in fine ff. de suppellect. legat. l. 3. ff. ad S.C.M. §. 7. Instit. de Testam. ordin. c. infamus 3. q. 7. c. penult. & ult. qui filii sint legitimi*. | | It pertains, therefore, to God's Providence and care that He not permit the Church, which He willed to be the pillar and foundation of truth, to err in a matter of such great importance by venerating as Pontiff one who is not the Pontiff. Or if He permits error regarding the person of the Pontiff himself, He nevertheless does not permit error regarding his authority—that is, that the same authority and power be attributed to a putative Pontiff as would be accorded to a true one, just as human laws establish the same principle in the case of a putative judge, witness, and marriage, as attested in *l. Barbarinus. de off. Praet. l. 3. in fine ff. de suppellect. legat. l. 3. ff. ad S.C.M. §. 7. Instit. de Testam. ordin. c. infamus 3. q. 7. c. penult. & ult. qui filii sint legitimi*. |
| XVIII. *Non obstat 18*. Eorum sententiam, qui Pontificem extra Concilium falli posse affirmant, probabilem esse, ergo illam tuto amplecti, docere, & si res ferat, exercere etiam possumus. | | XVIII.\ *Non obstat 18*. The opinion of those who affirm that the Pontiff can err outside of a Council is probable; therefore we can safely embrace, teach, and if the situation requires, even put this opinion into practice. |
| Respondeo. Sententiae alicuius probabilitatem ex duobus capitibus aestimari: ex rationum videl. gravitate ac momentis; & ex docentium auctoritate. Rationes quod attinet, aut nulla pro contraria sententia producuntur, aut tam infirmae fragilesque, & solutu tam faciles, ut ad flectendum in unam partem intellectum, eiusque assensum non dico extorquendum, sed invitandum, pondus exiguum habeant, imo nullum, si cum illis rationibus conferantur, quae in oppositum urgent. | | I respond. The probability of any opinion is evaluated from two sources: namely, from the weight and importance of the reasons; and from the authority of those who teach it. Concerning the reasons, either none are produced for the contrary opinion, or they are so weak and fragile, and so easy to refute, that they have little weight in bending the intellect to one side, and in not only—I say—extorting its assent, but inviting it; indeed, they have no weight at all when compared with those reasons that press toward the opposite conclusion. |
| Compara scripturas cum scripturis, Concilia cum Conciliis, Patres cum Patribus, Ecclesiae usum cum usu, rationes cum rationibus, & tunc demum videbis, quam vim movendo flectendoque intellectui habeant, quae ab Adversariis dicuntur: revoca etiam in animum Patrum Doctorumque censuras, quibus sententiam illam configunt, & tecum reputa, an aliquam probabilitatis speciem agnoscant: & censuras non Patrum quorumcumque, sed sanctitate & doctrina florentium, quosque non ut Doctores tantum, sed ut fastigia & vertices Doctorum omnes scholae venerantur. | | Compare scriptures with scriptures, Councils with Councils, Fathers with Fathers, the usage of the Church with usage, reasons with reasons, and only then will you see what power to move and bend the intellect the arguments of our Adversaries possess. Recall also the censures of the Fathers and Doctors with which they refute that opinion, and consider with yourself whether they acknowledge any appearance of probability: and not the censures of just any Fathers, but of those flourishing in sanctity and doctrine, whom all the schools venerate not only as Doctors but as the heights and peaks of Doctors. |
| Vix pro sententia, quam impugnamus, octodecimque auctores numerabis, ubi nostra omnes habet, quotquot ubique terrarum scripsere. Quis enim est Gerson, Almainus, Adrianus, ut illos Thomae Aquinati, Alberto M. Bonaventurae, Antonino, Bernardo, & omnibus fere opponas? Enimvero ad hos soles pallescunt illae stellae, disparentque, & tam fieri non potest, ut qui istorum auctoritatem rationesque spectat, aliquam in contraria sententia probabilis rationem videat, quam ut lucente in meridie sole radii aliquid aut lucis in stellis observet: imo multo minus; cum in caelo stellae sint plurimae, sol unus, a nobis vero soles sint plurimi, & ex adverso stellae paucissimae. | | You will scarcely number eighteen authors for the opinion which we oppose, whereas our position has all who have written anywhere throughout the world. For who are Gerson, Almain, and Adrian, that you should oppose them to Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great, Bonaventure, Antoninus, Bernard, and nearly all others? Indeed, in the presence of these suns those stars grow pale and disappear, and it is as impossible for one who beholds the authority and reasons of these men to see any basis for probability in the contrary opinion, as it is to observe any rays or light in the stars when the sun shines at midday: indeed, much less so; since in the sky there are many stars but only one sun, whereas on our side there are many suns, and on the opposing side very few stars. |
