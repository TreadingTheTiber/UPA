## Quaestio IX, Art. VI

[...]

1°\ *Divine faith* or *theological faith* refers to the assent which rests immediately upon divine revelation; the object of this kind of faith is revealed truths, believed on account of the truthfulness of God who reveals them. 2°\ Faith that is *divine and catholic*, or simply *catholic faith*, refers to revealed truths which are manifested in the doctrine of the Church; however, that revealed truths are manifested through the Church is accidental to faith, namely on our part; from which it appears that between divine faith and catholic faith there is essentially no difference. 3°\ *Ecclesiastical faith* rests upon the *assistance* of the Holy Spirit, by which the Church of Christ is preserved immune from any error in guarding the deposit of faith; hence it cannot be doubted that it is most firm and most certain. 4°\ *Human faith* rests upon the authority of men. — As for faith that is *mediately and indirectly divine*, by which not a few theologians maintain that theological conclusions, properly so called, are to be believed, this does not seem to differ from ecclesiastical faith.

[...]

Nevertheless, a contingent fact is sometimes so certain that it manifestly excludes any doubt whatsoever. In which case the conclusion, as a certain *part* of the major premise, seems to be a matter of faith. **Thus that proposition: *Leo XIII was duly elected as Roman Pontiff*, with the Church's acceptance following—by which even an illegitimate election becomes valid—cannot be called into question. Therefore the Salamancan theologians, Billuart, and others consider it more probable that a conclusion is a matter of faith when it follows from reasoning of this kind: *Every man duly elected as successor of Peter is the Supreme Pontiff of the Church. But Leo XIII was duly elected as successor of Peter. Therefore he is the Supreme Pontiff of the Church*.**
