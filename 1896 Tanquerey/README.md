**195. (B) *The Supreme Pontiff is infallible regarding dogmatic facts*.**
This is the common and true opinion. A dogmatic fact in general is *that which is so connected with a dogma of faith that* knowledge of it is necessary for teaching the dogma or for safely preserving it. (a) Of this kind are facts concerning the legitimacy of the Supreme Pontiff or an Ecumenical Council: **for unless it is known with certainty that this Pontiff is the legitimate successor of Peter,** or that this Council is truly ecumenical, it will not be established whether they have authority over the universal Church. All admit that the Church enjoys infallibility concerning the legitimacy of the Supreme Pontiff, and therefore cannot err when it unanimously recognizes this Pope as legitimate; otherwise the body of the Church would be separated from its center and head, which is contrary to its indefectibility and unity. It is likewise certain that the Church and the Pontiff can infallibly determine which Council is ecumenical or not; otherwise it would be doubtful whether the decrees issued by it are infallible or not. (b) Among dogmatic facts is also included the fact that a certain book contains some orthodox or heterodox doctrine, e.g., the fact that the five propositions condemned by *Innocent X* are truly contained in Jansenius's book "*Augustinus*". For better understanding, these points can be established: we do not contend that the Pope is infallible in judging that this book is by this or that author, or that the author, whose propositions are condemned, intended in his mind the sense which the words themselves convey; but that he can infallibly determine what sense the words of any book, considering the context, convey, and whether this sense is orthodox or not. For unless this were so, a heretic could spread errors with impunity and escape condemnation by saying that the Supreme Pontiff did not correctly understand the sense of the book. The Jansenists resorted to this subterfuge after the condemnation of the five propositions of Jansenius; but *Clement XI* openly declared that *respectful silence* is not sufficient, but that "the condemned sense of Jansenius's book in the five aforementioned propositions, *which their words convey*, must be received and condemned as heretical by all Christ's faithful not only with the mouth, but also with the *heart*."
