## Section IV, Chapter X

Concerning this difficulty, the fewer references found among the ancients in the terms in which it is now disputed, the more celebrated it has become in these times, and agitated by various arguments. For while all Catholic doctors agree, practically and morally, that it is most certain that this or that particular Pope, whom the Church has once proposed and accepted as true without any dissent, is the true and legitimate Pontiff and head of the entire Church; to the extent that anyone who would deny this could be punished not only as highly reckless and scandalous, but also as suspected of heresy, indeed as erring against the faith; **inasmuch as, given such consensus of the universal Church, which cannot err in matters of general fact pertaining to the general state of all the faithful, such as the true and Canonical election of the Pontiff, such a person could be presumed to deny this universal proposition, namely, that he who is legitimately elected is the Vicar of Christ and successor of Peter, which whoever denies is without doubt a heretic.** While, I say, all Catholics agree on this, whether this is absolutely a matter of faith, there are two opinions of theirs: the first denying, the other affirming, for the understanding of which, and also for the resolution of the more probable position.

It should be observed first that there exists, as it were, a twofold election of Supreme Pontiffs: one particular, which is carried out by the Lord Cardinals according to rules prescribed by the Supreme Pontiffs; **the other universal, which is carried out by the universal Church itself through peacefully accepting the prior election made by the Cardinals, and consequently the person designated for the Supreme Pontificate through that election. This, moreover, is the difference between both elections, or between the election made by the Most Eminent Cardinals and its peaceful acceptance by the universal Church: that this second election always becomes infallible for us, once it is supposed that this man has been duly elected and canonically made head of the Church, which is a matter in itself determinable of faith by the Church.** The first election, however, is different, as it can be flawed and doubtful, as is clearly gathered from the Council of Constance, session 39, where in determining that judging a doubtful election pertains to the Council itself, it sufficiently presupposes that there can be a doubtful or flawed election about which it may judge; although also on the part of the electors, the impediment of censure cannot be brought against the election. Indeed, to avoid schisms, and also as far as possible uncertainty of election, it was provided by a singular privilege in the Clementine "Ne Romani" (§ "Caeterum") concerning election, that no Cardinal should be rejected from the papal election on the pretext of any censure. Nevertheless, there remain many other causes for which an election can be rendered flawed or doubtful, both on the part of the election itself and on the part of the person elected, according to the defects which the laws themselves assign.

[...]

However, speaking of other conditions which in a papal election pertain only to positive law, and whose defects the Church consequently can remedy by its own authority, neither before nor after his acceptance can there be greater certainty about them than moral certainty; even if it is believed with the certainty of faith that *this particular Pope is the true Pope*; because since these conditions are not indispensably connected with this truth, as were the preceding ones; but despite their defect, and hence the nullity of the election made by the Lord Cardinals, **the Church can, by its acceptance, as if by a new election, remedy that nullity.** We can indeed, after that, correctly infer that *this particular Pope is the true Pope*, as well as all other things necessarily and irreplaceably joined with this truth; but not that the election is definitely not simoniacal, or something similar; but at most it can be established with certainty under a disjunction: either it is not simoniacal, if indeed it truly is not such; or if it is such, that defect is remedied and supplied by the Church, when we would see such an election peacefully accepted by it without any dissent, and also the Supreme Pontiff elected. **The reason for this is that impediments introduced by positive human law, which render the election of the Supreme Pontiff invalid, are derived from such laws that never speak of, nor can they have place except with respect to that first election which in external appearance and in the external forum is made by the Lord Cardinals; wherefore, even if that election was null due to some such hidden impediment, there still follows another election, which cannot be invalidated by any positive law, which the whole Church makes by peacefully accepting, as we suppose, that elected man as the true Pontiff.** For this acceptance, although it proceeds from a preceding error of fact, is nevertheless not conditional but absolute: it is indeed better for the Church to have as Pontiff someone who was invalidly elected, than to unknowingly lack a true Pontiff, and to venerate as such one who in reality is not. This is by nearly the same reasoning by which we said at the end of the previous chapter that God deemed it more expedient for the greater good of the Church to confer Pontifical dignity on a person who is simply capable of it and legitimately elected, by one election or another, whether worthy or unworthy, rather than solely on one who is worthy; because it would result in much greater damage to the Church to often lack a true head, and to always be able to doubt about him, than to occasionally have one who is infirm and weak.

[...]

I. Conclusion: **it is of divine faith immediately in itself that this man, Clement IX, duly elected, is the true Pontiff and head of the entire Church.** The first foundation of this position is derived from the Council of Constance in its condemnation of Wycliffe's errors, which is found in Session 8, final section, where Pope Martin V orders that heretics who seek reconciliation, as well as those suspected of heresy, should be questioned to test their faith, among other things: *"Whether they believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at that time, with his name properly expressed, is the successor of Blessed Peter having supreme authority in the Church of God."* These words do not speak of the truth of that proposition in general—*that anyone canonically elected is the true Supreme Pontiff*—but particularly about him who is Pontiff at that time, expressing his proper name, e.g., Clement IX. And concerning this person whose name is expressed, Martin V commands that the person suspected in faith be interrogated whether he believes that such a person is the true successor of Peter having supreme authority in the Church of God. If such a proposition were not of divine faith immediately in itself, neither would the Supreme Pontiff require, nor could he require, an act of faith concerning it, for he cannot propose anything to be believed as a matter of faith that does not pertain to faith, as is sufficiently established. Therefore, it must be said that the aforementioned proposition is of divine faith immediately in itself.

The second reason is derived from the fact that the Supreme Pontiff is the supreme head of the Church and the supreme Monarch; therefore, just as we believe by faith from what was said in the previous section that this particular Church in which we exist is the true Church of Christ, it must also pertain to the same faith that this particular man who has been legitimately elected, to whom the Church is united as to its head, is the true Supreme Pontiff. The antecedent is a matter of faith, namely, that the Supreme Pontiff is the supreme head of the Church and the supreme Monarch; the consequence therefore is proven because it is of the essence of this particular Church that it be united and joined to its head existing at the time, once his legitimate election has been completed. Indeed, its truth and unity depend most especially on this, given Christ's institution, who willed that the Church's Monarchical state would exist in perpetuity. Therefore, just as it is a matter of faith that this particular Church is the true Church of Christ, so also must it be a matter of faith that, once a legitimate election has taken place (whatever that may be, of which more shortly), this particular man, Clement IX, happily reigning, to whom the Church is united as to its head, is the true Supreme Pontiff. This consequence is most certain, once the truth of the antecedent is established—namely, that it is of the essence of this particular Church that it be united as to its head to this particular Pontiff legitimately elected—which I prove thus: just as from the fact that rationality is of the essence of man as such and in the abstract, it manifestly follows that this particular rationality, or part of rationality, is of the essence of this particular man, e.g., Peter; so similarly, from the fact that Christ the Lord willed the Church's state to be Monarchical and that there would be a perpetual succession of Supreme Pontiffs in it, it also necessarily follows that He willed that of the essence of this particular Church in which we exist would also be this particular Pontiff existing at the time, legitimately elected. **For it is not sufficient that the Church subject itself as to its supreme head to anyone rightly elected as Pontiff, as if in general; rather, it must be united and subject to some visible head. But it is not visible unless it is determined in particular. Furthermore, if it were not certain that this particular Pontiff, rightly elected, to whom the Church here and now is united, is the true Pontiff, by what reasoning could we doubt him? We could also doubt his predecessor, and thus the entire series going back, and consequently the truth of the Bishops who were created by them. Therefore, lest we say that the entire certainty of the true Church and Hierarchical Order collapses, we must admit that it is immediately a matter of faith in itself that this particular Pontiff, rightly elected, is the true Pontiff; and for us, once the whole Church has peacefully accepted him.**

The third reason is founded on this: that this particular Pontiff, duly elected, is so much the head of the Church that he is simultaneously also the rule of faith, insofar as he enjoys, among other privileges, infallibility in defining matters pertaining to faith. Therefore, it immediately pertains to the faith that this particular Pontiff, legitimately elected, is the true Pontiff. The antecedent will be made clear from what will be said below; now the consequence is proven, because when something is a rule of faith, it must be no less credible through faith that it is a rule than that what is determined or regulated by it is of faith. Just as when a book of Scripture is proposed as canonical, it is as much of faith that such a book is canonical and received through God's revelation as it is of faith that all it contains is true. Otherwise, we could never be certain about matters defined or handed down in sacred books, as is self-evident. Therefore, if it is once supposed that this particular Pontiff, duly elected, is the rule of faith in defining matters pertaining to it, it must also pertain to that same faith as something credible through it that he is the true Pontiff. This is the only difference between a canonical book and the Supreme Pontiff, insofar as each in its own way is called a rule of faith: that the Supreme Pontiff is such only temporally and dependently on certain temporal conditions that are newly established. Since these are not revealed in particular, there arises that doubt concerning the certainty with which it is held as a matter of faith that this particular man, duly elected, is the true Pontiff—a doubt which does not exist regarding a Canonical book. The latter, being something permanent, does not require any new declaration once it has been proposed to the faithful by the Church as authentic, as the Supreme Pontiff does require, since the nature of such a rule, which is animate and eligible for a time, demands it. Nevertheless, when such a declaration is made through election and its peaceful acceptance by the universal Church, we must hold with certain faith that this particular Pontiff is the true Pontiff, since the Church, being the pillar and foundation of truth, cannot err in accepting and proposing as an animate rule of faith that which is not such.

[...]

But this objection, or response, does not weaken the force of our reasoning, once it is established that the Supreme Pontiff is the living rule of faith; for this is the difference between the Supreme Pontiff proposing matters of faith to be believed by his definition, and an evangelical minister preaching those same matters: that the latter does not function as a determinative rule of matters of faith, but only as a minister announcing to others what ought to be believed; hence we are neither bound to believe that he is a true and legitimate minister, nor are those who believe the matters proposed by him moved to do so by his authority, but rather by the credibility of what is proposed, such that unless these matters are sufficiently proposed, and their credibility made known, they are not bound to believe. But the Supreme Pontiff, once it is admitted that he enjoys the privilege of infallibility in matters pertaining to faith, proposes those matters to be believed as the living rule of faith, or as the supreme judge determining what ought to be believed, so that by his authority the faithful are obligated to believe those things; **whence it is necessary that they believe, not merely with moral certainty (which could absolutely admit falsity), but with the certainty of faith, that this particular Pontiff existing at this time and governing the Church is truly its Pontiff. Otherwise, if it happened that the authority which this particular person defining possesses were called into doubt, we could not be certain that the matters defined by him remained matters of faith: just as if a canonical book were called into question as to whether it truly is such, certainty could not be had concerning the things contained in it.**

[...]

Therefore, although those things which have been revealed by God in the first general manner cannot and should not be believed individually, for the reason given above, namely that only those things are to be believed by faith which, if they were not true, would make God liable to the charge of falsehood; nevertheless, when the revelation was made in the second general manner, then individual assent must be a matter of faith. **For that experience which we then have of the Church speaking, in whose mouth God has placed the teaching authority of faith, is a certain completion of divine speech, through which God Himself is understood to reveal this particular object: that this specific Pope, duly elected, is the true Pope. Wherefore, if that common consensus of the Church, by which this and similar matters are proposed to us, were false and deceptive, we could complain of God as a deceiver, inasmuch as He would be contributing to that judgment or consensus which would prudently be considered by us as divine speech, although it would not be so; just as if, through demonic illusions, He were to allow such a convincing appearance to be presented in favor of some error—for example, by the Antichrist or another false prophet—as the Catholic faith possesses through true miracles.**

[...]

This is proven because, although such a proposition in itself can often be a matter of faith—namely, where such an election occurs with all the conditions required both by divine law and ecclesiastical human law—nevertheless, since the sacred College of Cardinals does not enjoy the privilege of infallibility (for nowhere is it read that this was granted to it, but only to the Church), it can sometimes elect someone having an essential defect, or, if he has no defect, render its election invalid on other grounds, which it cannot remedy by its own authority, as we noted above concerning the Church and will soon explain again. Since the Lord Cardinals are bound, under penalty of nullity, to elect according to the form prescribed by the Supreme Pontiffs, as is sufficiently evident from their texts, **therefore, that this particular Pontiff existing at the present time is the true Pontiff is not rendered a matter of faith for us precisely through the election of the Lord Cardinals alone, unless, in addition, the consensus of the universal Church is added. Hence it follows that those first acts by which the faithful recognize the newly elected Pontiff are not, with respect to this, acts of divine faith, but of human and fallible faith and prudence, until, with the common acceptance of the Church and the faithful having been added, there results in individuals the obligation of divine faith to believe that he is the true Pontiff.**

[...]

Someone may therefore inquire at what time the said acceptance by the Church begins, and through it a sufficient proposition is made, so that it becomes a matter of faith for us that this particular Pontiff, duly elected, is the true Pontiff; and the faithful are obligated to believe this—whether this occurs as soon as the Cardinals proclaim the elected one to those faithful who are present at the place of election, or rather when the matter has already been divulged throughout the whole world and the Church spread everywhere. It is answered from what has been said that immediately after the concordant election by the Cardinals, the faithful are indeed bound by the precept of obedience and charity to obey the elected Pontiff, such that no one can rightfully separate from him without schism. For this, the moral certainty which is obtained through such an election concerning the duly elected person is sufficient—not, however, for an assent of faith, **but for that [assent of faith] the acceptance of the Church is additionally required. This begins negatively as soon as the Church, wherever it knows of such an election, does not contradict it; positively, however, when it is immediately acquiesced to by the prelates and people who are present at the place of election, and gradually in other parts of the world, it is also admitted by the rest of the faithful, both prelates and subjects. Thus, those who see or hear of the elected Pope, and observe that he is not contradicted but admitted by all, are bound according to the more certain opinion which we defend, to believe with divine and supernatural faith that this particular Pontiff, duly elected and accepted by the Church as such, and proposed through its acceptance, is the true Pontiff and successor of St. Peter.**

[...]

Finally, to the third proof, it is answered from what has been said that the Church does not accept that election and the elected person merely as a matter of pure obedience, but moreover as a matter pertaining to faith; because, as we have said, it accepts him as its true visible head. Hence, with the same certainty of faith by which we believe that this particular congregation of the faithful spread throughout the whole world, which adheres to the Supreme Roman Pontiff as to its visible head, **is the true Church of Christ, we are also bound to believe that this particular Pontiff to whom it thus adheres, and whom it accepts as legitimately elected, is the true Pontiff. Furthermore, the Church acknowledges him not only as its head but also as an infallible rule of faith, which, as we have seen above, cannot occur unless it is also a matter of faith that he, thus acknowledged, is truly the rule of faith. Therefore, one who would deny that this man is the Pope, whom the entire Church has once accepted as duly elected, would be not only schismatic but also heretical.** For he would not only rend the unity of the Church like those who from the beginning might elect two Pontiffs, of whom it is unknown which is the true Pontiff, but would additionally profess a false dogma; because he would deny that one whom the universal Church peacefully receives as such should be held as the true Pontiff, and therefore as the true head of the Church and the true rule of faith. Wherefore then that which St. Jerome teaches in his commentary on the third chapter of Titus would especially apply, and after him St. Thomas in the Secunda Secundae, question 39, article 1, reply to objection 3: "No schism exists that does not contrive some heresy for itself, so that it may appear to have withdrawn from the Church with justification."

This response is understood not only concerning the current Supreme Pontiff during his lifetime, but must also be extended to all others who legitimately presided over the Church in all past ages: if we are once assured that they were accepted by the Church, either because we witnessed it ourselves, or because some definition of theirs remains, in which, by declaring something concerning the faith, they simultaneously left declared that they were the true head of the Church and the true rule of faith. **For if we had no certainty of such acceptance, then it would not be a matter of faith for us except incidentally, but we would hold it merely through human historical record. Unless we would prefer to say that we can always have sufficient certainty of faith in this matter through that principle of faith which holds that the Church of Christ has persevered continuously as one and the same from the beginning until these times; and since it is of the essence of the Church to have a true head, all Pontiffs legitimately elected in their time must have been accepted by the Church.** Or if they were not legitimate, or even doubtful, they were rejected so that the Church could proceed to another election, lest, contrary to Christ's institution and promise, the Church remain headless and be said to have perished. This is how heretics argue when they contend that at least from the time of Pope Urban VI, the true succession has failed; from this they think they sufficiently infer that it can no longer be certain whether there is a true succession to the Supreme Pontiff, or where in the world the true visible Church exists—among whose principal marks we place the legitimate succession of Supreme Pontiffs continuing to these times, as well as the perpetual union with them and adherence to them as to the supreme and universal head.

**If, among some, not the entire Church accepts this truth as a matter of faith, since there are many Catholic Doctors who do not admit it, and yet are not considered heretics on that account; I respond that not all accept it as a matter of faith speculatively, and in explicit terms, or considering it inadequately, thinking it sufficient for the Pontifical office in the Church to have a certain moral or natural certainty that this particular Pope is the true Pope; nevertheless, all accept it virtually, while they profess to believe in one, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, of which this particular duly elected Pope, existing for the time being, is truly the head of all, and according to the more true opinion, the true rule of faith in it; hence only from ignorance, as we noted above, do they think they do not believe what in reality and in fact they do believe, and thus they contradict themselves as it were; wherefore they are neither to be considered heretics, nor to be punished as such; however, it would be different if some publicly and obstinately denied this truth, according to our opinion, which we think pertains to the faith, and which almost all Theologians and Canonists teach, although they differ somewhat in the manner of explaining it.**
