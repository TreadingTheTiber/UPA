We cite as examples of dogmatic facts "the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of texts", e.g., of Jansen's book, omitting the facts of whether such a council is infallible, or such a version of the Bible is authentic, **or such a pope is a true pope,** etc., etc., in order to avoid the impression that with such examples as are accepted by everybody as instances of *divine* faith, we seek to prejudge the very same question we are going to deal with. But, in reality, both the former and the latter are equally dogmatic facts, and nothing more than dogmatic facts. Modern authors, when dealing with dogmatic facts, ordinarily cite Jansen's fact and not the fact of whether such a council is infallible, etc., because otherwise they would be equivalently making obvious the inconsistency or incoherence into which they later fall by accepting certain facts as of divine faith, and certain others as of ecclesiastical faith. As we shall see, the *dogmatic* character of all those facts is exactly the same. There is but one *atom species of dogmatic facts*, just as there is but one atom species of *theological conclusions*. To say otherwise is, in our view, pure empiricism.

Thus, if it is revealed that *all* things have been created by God, it is *implicitly* revealed, and definable as of divine faith, that *this* particular thing, e.g., the angels, have been created. If it is revealed that *all* men have been redeemed by Christ, it is implicitly revealed, and definable as of divine faith, that *this* man has been redeemed. If it is revealed that *all* ecumenical councils are infallible rules of faith, it is implicitly revealed, and definable as of divine faith, that *this ecumenical council, e.g., the Tridentine, is an infallible rule of faith*. If it is revealed that all the popes accepted by the universal Church are successors of St. Peter, it is implicitly revealed that this pope, e.g., our Most Holy Father Pius XI, is a successor of St. Peter, or a true pope. On this point all, or almost all, theologians are today agreed. But precisely because it is admitted by almost all theologians, it becomes necessary to tarry awhile in its analysis in order to be able later to pass on from what everybody admits to what everybody should admit if he were logical.

It is said, and said truly, that it is implicitly revealed that the Tridentine is infallible, that the Vulgate is authentic in matter of faith and morals, that the actual pope is a true pope. Now, then, we all know that the deposit of divine revelation was closed upon the death of the last of the apostles and that no new public or Catholic revelation was thenceforth possible. How then, is it possible for such facts as the Vulgate, the Tridentine, or the actual pope, to have been truly revealed by God when they took place many centuries after the apostles? Do not such facts constitute a true *addition* to the revealed deposit? Is this not tantamount to an admission that the Church is capable of giving us *new dogmas*?

Any student of theology knows the answer – and a good answer it is – given to these questions. The revealed deposit was closed with the last of the apostles with respect to *new* Catholic *revelation*; however, it was not closed, but remains and will remain open, with respect to the infallible *explication* or *application* of the old revelation. The Church cannot give us *new* dogmas in the sense of being *new unqualifiedly* (simpliciter), or new in *substance*; but she can give us new dogmas in the sense of being *new only somehow* (secundum quid, i.e., in some manner), i.e., new as to their *explication*, provided that such explication is not done through new revelations, as was the case until the death of the last of the apostles, but only through mere infallibility or *assistance* of the Holy Spirit.[^6] Now, this, and only this, is what the Church does when she applies a proposition that has been revealed in a *universal* form to a *particular* proposition.

Hence the minor does not enter the reasoning as the *formal motive* or as the cause of the conclusion, but only as a *condition*. Now, then, it is a commonplace among theologians that in any case where the minor enters the reasoning, not as the formal motive, but simply as the condition to explicate or apply the revealed major, the conclusion is also revealed and definable as of *divine* faith. Thus theologians commonly admit that the Church can define as of divine faith, and not only as of ecclesiastical faith, that such a Council, e.g. the Vatican, is infallible, or that such a pope, e.g. the actual pope, is a true pope.

275.\ If such early Thomists as Torquemada, Cajetan, Cano, etc., denied that certain dogmatic facts, including the fact that "such a pope is a true pope," were of divine faith, this is explained by taking into account that the *revealed* status of the Church's infallibility with respect to those facts was *not yet clear* at the time. Those great Thomists have never been guilty of the glaring inconsistency involved in admitting the *revelation* of the Church's infallibility with respect to something and denying that that same thing is of *divine* faith once it has been defined. Since today both Thomists and non-Thomists concede the *revealed* status of the Church's infallibility with respect to dogmatic facts, everybody should concede that such facts are of *divine* faith once they have been defined.

There has been progress in Catholic theology in the matter of dogmatic facts as in so many others. As it almost always happens, the practice or attitude of the Roman Church has been a principal factor of this progress. Clement VIII's forceful attitude, at the beginning of the 17th century, against the supporters of Alcalá's notorious thesis ("It is not of faith that this individual man, e.g., Clement VIII, is a true Pontiff"), oriented the thinking of theologians in the study of that dogmatic fact in particular, and since then almost everybody admits that the fact is of divine faith.[^10]

Subsequently, the no less forceful attitude of Popes Innocent X, Alexander XII, and Clement IX against the resistance and the interminable quibbles presented by the Jansenists, similarly oriented Catholic theology in the study of the dogmatic fact in general. Since then there is almost no theologian who does not admit that it has been revealed that the Church is infallible with respect to every dogmatic fact. For every Thomist this is equivalent to saying that *every dogmatic fact* has been *revealed*, and consequently that it has been *revealed* that this dogmatic fact is infallibly true once it has been defined. Or in other words, that it is of *divine* faith since divine faith extends itself not only to *what God reveals* but also to *what God reveals as true*. However, although such a fact is *of divine faith* inasmuch as it is contained as a particular in a revealed universal, nonetheless *it is not of divine faith that such a fact is of divine faith* inasmuch as the revelation of the universal has not yet been *defined*. Hence, *no one who denies it is a heretic*.

We beg the reader's indulgence for so much insistence and repetition, but all of it is necessary in order to uproot ideas that are so widespread as that of the modern and heterogeneous *ecclesiastical* faith. In our opinion the term *ecclesiastical* faith would have perfectly described the kind of faith or *human* – not divine – *religious* assent given by us to the *non-infallible* teachings of the Church.

[^10]: "This view was given *great weight* by Clement VIII, who incarcerated some teachers for maintaining the contrary, and commanded them to go to Rome to give an account of the opinion which that See considered *deserving of punishment*," (PETRUS HURTADO, *De Fide*, d.3) Confronted by this attitude of Rome the theologians of the Society as well as the Thomists made such haste to support the papal directives that presently Lugo writes that "our later teachers commonly" teach this doctrine (*De Fide*, n.326); and the Salmanticenses, after quoting for their view almost all the Thomists posterior to Clement VIII, qualify it as "the *common opinion*" (*loc. cit.*, n.30) Thus, to argue for the view that dogmatic facts are of divine faith once they have been defined by the Church, the modern theologian needs do no more nor less than apply to dogmatic facts in general exactly the same principles that have been applied by almost all theologians since Clement VIII to the fact of "whether it is of divine faith that such a pope is a true pope once he has been accepted by the Church", or "whether it is of divine faith such a council is a rule of faith once it has been accepted by the Church as ecumenical". Neither more nor less.

[...]

Nonetheless, it has been defined, or it is definable as of divine faith and, hence, it is *revealed*, that the Tridentine Council is ecumenical or a rule of faith, that the Canon of the mass is free from error, that the Vulgate is authentic with respect to fundamental matters of faith and morals, that our Holy Father Pius XI is a true pope, that this man has been redeemed by Christ.
