## Tractatus De Regulis Fidei, Diss. 4, Art. 9

This question arose and became notable at the beginning of the previous century, when certain individuals in Spain, anticipating that the judgment of Clement VIII would be contrary to their opinions, which were then being examined in Rome, sought to prepare a way to evade it. They proposed and defended in public theses that it was not a matter of faith that Clement VIII was Peter's Successor. The Supreme Pontiff ordered the authors of these theses to be imprisoned, and subsequently the contrary position began to be defended in public theses in Rome. There is no one among Catholics who does not hold with certainty that Benedict XIV, or whoever is currently occupying the See, is the Supreme Pontiff; but they hold this with different degrees of certainty. Some maintain it with moral certainty only, others with theological certainty; still others, and more commonly—to which position we subscribe—with the certainty of faith.

You will say: This particular proposition: *"This man Benedict XIV, accepted by the Church as the successor of Peter, is the Supreme Pontiff,"* is not contained in this universal proposition: *"Every man accepted by the universal Church as the successor of Peter is the Supreme Pontiff,"* unless one presupposes that Benedict XIV was rightly elected. However, it is neither revealed nor a matter of faith that he was rightly elected, but this is known only from human testimony. The comparison is similar: it is a matter of faith that every properly consecrated host should be adored; yet it is not a matter of faith that this particular host should be adored, because it is not a matter of faith that it has been consecrated. **I respond by denying the major premise. For this supposition has no place in our case, neither for the universal proposition nor for the particular one; because since the Church is infallible in accepting the rule of faith, as I will soon explain, whether the Pontiff was properly made or not properly elected, by the very fact that the Church accepts him, he is the true Pontiff and the rule of faith, and the Church's acceptance supplies for any defect that might have crept into the election. And if indeed the Canons seem to say the opposite, they are to be understood as referring to an election prior to the Church's acceptance.** Hence the disparity regarding the host: for the Church does not declare this host to be consecrated, and therefore contained under the universal proposition; just as it declares in actual practice that Benedict XIV is accepted by the Church as the Successor of Peter and therefore contained under the universal proposition. Moreover, since the consecration of this host is a particular matter not pertaining to the universal governance of the Church, the Church would not be infallible in declaring this, nor could its declaration supply for a defect in consecration. However, for a particular proposition contained in a universal proposition of faith to be a matter of faith for us, it must be certainly established for us that it is contained in the universal proposition of faith.

Proof 2. Conclusion. **It is a matter of faith that the Church cannot err in accepting the Rule of faith. But in accepting this man as Supreme Pontiff, she accepts him as the Rule of faith. Therefore, it is a matter of faith that this man, whom she accepts as Pontiff, is the true Pontiff. The minor premise is certain. The major premise is proven thus: If the Church could err in accepting the Rule of faith, she could err in accepting the definitions emanating from this uncertain Rule; just as if she could err in declaring a book to be Canonical, or in accepting an Ecumenical Council, she could err in adhering to the contents of that book or to the matters defined by that council, and thus the Gates of hell could prevail against her.** Therefore, etc. Confirmation: It is a matter of faith that the Church in which we are is the true and Catholic Church. But it is not a true and Catholic Church that is not united to its legitimate head. **Therefore, by the very fact that the Church accepts this man as Pontiff and head to whom she is united, it is a matter of faith that he is the Pontiff and head of the Church. Nor should you say that the Church can exist without a head; for there is a ready remedy in the Election of a new head. But if she has a fictitious head, which she is unaware of, no remedy remains; for she cannot provide herself with another, and she is bound to obey the fictitious one when he commands and defines.**

Objection 1. It is neither revealed nor a matter of faith that Benedict XIV is baptized and male; therefore, it is not a matter of faith that he is the Supreme Pontiff. The consequence is proven thus: Benedict XIV cannot be the Supreme Pontiff unless he is baptized and male. Therefore, if it is not revealed that he is baptized and male, it is not revealed that he is the Pontiff. Response: I deny the consequence. To the proof, I deny the consequence. From the fact that something is revealed, it does not follow that everything necessarily connected with what is revealed must also be revealed; rather, theological discourse consists precisely in addressing those things which are necessarily connected with revealed matters. For example, that Christ is man is revealed, and since risibility is necessarily connected with being human, it is inferred that Christ is capable of laughter with theological certainty, but not with the certainty of faith. Now there is a special revelation only regarding the person accepted as Pontiff, not regarding the conditions required for this office, but these are inferred from revelation with theological consequence and certainty. **Thus, whereas before Benedict XIV's acceptance as Pontiff, it was only morally certain that he was baptized, now after his acceptance, it is certain with theological certainty.** Similarly: A definition promulgated by a Council that the Church accepts as ecumenical is revealed and pertains to faith; for this, it is necessarily presupposed that the matter defined was previously discussed with diligent and mature examination, and that the judges seated were true Bishops. Neither of these, however, is revealed nor a matter of faith; but because it is a matter of faith that the Church cannot err in accepting an Ecumenical Council, and that its definition cannot be false, it is inferred as certain with theological certainty that all necessities were present, that sufficient discussion was conducted, and that the judges seated, at least in a competent number, were true Bishops.
