## Disputatio II, Quæstio III

*Is it a matter of Faith that Clement XI is the true Vicar of Christ?*

**Thesis.** **It must be said that it is a material object of divine Faith that Clement XI is the true Vicar of Christ our Lord and successor of Peter.** This position is commonly affirmed by leading theologians (Amicus, Báñez, Cano, Córdoba, etc.) against Cajetan.

**Reason.** **A theological conclusion drawn from one revealed premise and another premise known with moral evidence is itself matter of Faith.** Here the revealed premise is: *Everyone duly elected by the Church as Pontiff is the true Vicar of Christ.* The premise known to the whole Church with moral evidence is: *Clement XI has been duly and canonically elected.* **Therefore the conclusion that Clement XI is the true Vicar of Christ is to be believed with divine Faith.**

**Confirmation from Constance.** Martin V in the Council of Constance decrees that those suspected of heresy are to be asked whether they believe that *the Pope canonically elected, whoever he may be at the time, is Peter’s successor having supreme authority in the Church*. **To deny this is to incur suspicion of heresy.**

**Further confirmation from the Church and Councils.** We are bound by **divine faith** to believe that the visible Church is the true Church of God, and that particular Councils—e.g., the Council of Trent—were true and catholic, assisted by the Holy Spirit. But **the visible Church cannot subsist with members alone without a head, nor can an acephalous (headless) Council be true and legitimate.** Therefore **it is a matter of faith that the visible Church and a legitimate Council have a visible head distinct from the invisible one, Christ the Lord**, and consequently **that this particular Pope is truly Christ’s Vicar.** The infallible authority of defining matters of faith belongs to the Church and to a Council *by reason of its head*; when the Apostolic See is vacant nothing can be defined. Hence **one cannot believe with divine Faith that a Council is legitimate and assisted by the Holy Spirit unless it is believed to be united to its head**, and therefore unless **it is a matter of Faith that the Pope then reigning is the true Vicar of Christ.**

[...]

**II. Objection 1.** *God has nowhere revealed that Clement XI is the true Pope; therefore this cannot be believed with divine faith. Nor is it a matter of faith that Clement XI was validly baptized or possesses the other essentials of the pontificate; therefore it is not of faith that he is truly Vicar of Christ.*

**Response.** I distinguish. Explicitly this is not revealed; implicitly it is. **In the very revelation that Peter and his successors are Vicars of Christ it is implicitly revealed that this particular Pontiff, canonically elected and whose election is established, is truly Vicar of Christ and head of the Church.** Thus, just as it is of faith that this particular Church is the true Church of God, so it is of faith that this particular Pontiff is Christ’s Vicar.

**To the confirmation.** Granted that we do not have a special revelation that this or that infant was baptized, **once the legitimate election of a man as Pope is established, it is likewise of faith that he is baptized, is truly a man, and possesses the essentials required for the pontificate**, for these are included in the very notion of Pontiff. **Before the election is established, such facts are not yet believed by divine Faith; after it is established, they are implicitly contained in the faith we profess that he is the true Pontiff.** Questions about whether sacred orders are strictly essential to the pontificate (as Arriaga discusses) do not overturn this conclusion.

[...]

**III. Objection 2.** *Sometimes the Church has erred in accepting someone as true Pontiff; therefore it is not a matter of faith that the Pontiff accepted by the Church is the true Vicar of Christ.* This is alleged on the basis of stories about Pope Joan (John VIII), the deposition of Eugene IV at Basel, and the claim that many Roman Pontiffs have erred in faith or at least could fall into heresy and thereby lose the pontificate.

**Response.** **I deny that the Church has ever erred in accepting a false head.** The tale of Pope Joan is a fable, as Bellarmine, Becanus and others explain: John VIII was mockingly called a woman on account of his softness, especially toward Photius and other heretics. Eugene IV was deposed not by a catholic Council but by a schismatic conventicle. At times **the Church has not yet recognized her true head because his legitimate election was not yet established; nevertheless, the universal Church has never conspired to adhere to a false head.**

Moreover, **even where human ecclesiastical law would render an election null—for example, a simoniacal election condemned by the bull of Julius II—yet if the Church accepts such a man as Pope, his acts are valid and he must be regarded as true Pontiff until he is juridically convicted of the impediment.** This is illustrated by the civil law case of *Barbarius* in the Digest, *On the Office of the Praetor*. **Thus, lest the Church be left without a head, natural law in some manner prevails over such positive laws declaring an election null.**

**To the claim that many Popes have erred in faith.** **No true Pope, teaching ex cathedra, has ever erred**, whatever heretics assert. Peter’s denial was with his mouth, not with his heart, nor did he teach Judaism, but merely tolerated certain practices. Many Doctors even deny that the Pope can fall into heresy at all, in light of Christ’s words in Luke 22: *“I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith may not fail.”* But even setting this aside, **so long as the Pope has not been declared a heretic, the papal dignity remains in him.** As Suárez, Cajetan and Córdoba teach, **just as the election must be established in order that someone be believed to be Pope, so heresy must be established in order that he cease to be believed Pope.**

According to apostolic tradition **the Pope loses the pontificate by the crime of heresy, or by perpetual insanity (when he is no longer morally a man), but not by other crimes**, for *the first See is judged by no one*. Yet **the Church must be certain of the fact—heresy or insanity—before he ceases to be Pope**, and by the interior assistance of the Holy Spirit **he does not err when defining those things which pertain to faith, religion, and the governance of the Church.**

**Response to the claim that denying Clement’s legitimacy would be schism but not heresy.** Someone who refuses submission to Clement XI while admitting him to be true Pontiff is indeed a schismatic, sinning against charity and the unity of the Church, but not against faith. **However, one who denies that Clement XI is the true Pontiff, once his legitimate election is established, sins both against charity and against faith.** Yet he is not punished as a formal heretic, since the Church has not yet solemnly proposed this particular truth as something to be believed *de fide*. **For heresy requires pertinacious contradiction of what the Church proposes to be believed as revealed by God.**

[...]

**IV.** Other historical objections—such as those concerning Pope Formosus, who ruled for six years and was later declared a pseudo‑pontiff by Stephen VII (who even re‑ordained those ordained by Formosus), or Honorius I, listed among those condemned by the Sixth Council—are treated at length by Bellarmine in *De Romano Pontifice*, book IV. In brief, **Formosus was a legitimate Pontiff; Stephen VII erred not as Pope but as a private man**, driven by personal animosity, and **Honorius is found among the condemned only in lists drawn up by schismatics, not by Catholics.**
