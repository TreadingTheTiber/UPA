## Articulus Trigesimus Quintus: De Infallibilitate Ecclesiæ circa facta dogmatica

[...]

**I. On the notion of dogmatic fact.** — **1.** A dogmatic fact is said to be a fact which, although not contained in the sources of revelation, is nevertheless so connected with revealed doctrine that knowledge of that fact is necessary for teaching a dogma and for safely preserving it (Mazzella).

**2.** Dogmatic facts of this kind are of different types:

*a)* **facts upon which depends the authority of councils, of Roman Pontiffs, or even the validity of episcopal ordination; thus the fact of the legitimate convocation of some council, the legitimate election of a Roman Pontiff, the valid consecration of some bishop are dogmatic facts.** Thus the Church, against the Old Catholics, holds that the First Vatican Council was legitimately convoked, and Leo XIII declared Anglican ordinations invalid.

*b)* The meaning of signs by which revealed doctrine is either expressed or denied = *dogmatic texts*: thus it is a dogmatic fact to determine the meaning of some term which the Church uses in defining a dogma, or the meaning of some book which is condemned by the Church as heretical.

[...]

**II. The Catholic doctrine** concerning the infallibility of the Church regarding dogmatic facts appears most clearly in the Jansenist case, insofar as the apostolic constitutions require **internal and unconditional assent** to the condemnation of Jansenius's book according to the sense intended by the author and expressed through the five propositions that were extracted from it. The same principle, however, appears in other condemnations and judgments concerning dogmatic facts. To this is added the common consensus of theologians.

**III. Thesis: The Church is infallible concerning dogmatic facts.**

*Proof* 1. *From the object and purpose of infallibility.* The Church is infallible concerning revealed truths to be guarded and expounded. **But it cannot infallibly guard and expound revealed truths if it errs concerning dogmatic facts.**

*Proof* 2. *From the nature and condition of the Church's magisterium.* — The magisterium of the Church teaches through words, as through signs of concepts and doctrine. But error concerning signs or the meaning of signs simultaneously involves error concerning doctrine. Therefore, **the Church is necessarily infallible also concerning the signs of doctrine.**

Similarly P. MARÍN-SOLÁ, l. c., I, 454 ff.

*Proof* 3. Without infallibility concerning dogmatic facts, **the entire infallibility of the Church would be rendered vain and ineffectual**. **To what purpose would the dogmatic definitions of Councils and Roman Pontiffs serve if their legitimate convocation or election can be called into doubt?** To what purpose does a dogmatic definition itself serve if there is doubt whether the Church has employed the correct term to express true doctrine? Who can believe the symbols of faith if the meaning of the terms is not established?

**IV. Objections.** — 1. Dogmatic facts are in no way revealed, e.g., that Pius XI was legitimately elected. Therefore, they are entirely outside the object of infallibility.

*Response.* Hence dogmatic facts in no way pertain to the **primary object** [of infallibility], yet they do pertain to the **secondary object**, which indeed also comprehends things connected with revealed truths.

[...]

**V. Concerning the manner in which the Church judges dogmatic facts.** — A dogmatic fact can be considered in two ways: *a)* according to itself and as a mere historical fact: and thus it is outside the scope of the Church's infallibility; *b)* as it is connected with some dogma: and thus it becomes an object of infallibility.

From this follows the manner by which the Church judges dogmatic fact *de facto*. For a merely historical fact is determined by historical arguments, and the Church by no means neglects arguments of this kind; but a dogmatic fact as such—that is, as connected with the law of doctrine—is adjudicated by **dogmatic arguments**, that is, by arguing and proceeding from the **truth of the dogma** which is in question. In this manner the Church properly judges concerning dogmatic fact, and in such judgment is **preserved from error through the assistance of the Holy Spirit.**

By this method the Roman Pontiffs condemned propositions excerpted from the book of Jansenius as heretical (a doctrinal judgment) and consequently simply held that the excerpted propositions were truly contained in the said book (a judgment concerning dogmatic fact).

[^6]: Thus Cl. DE GROOT writes: "A dogmatic fact is contained in two things: namely, a question of law, whether such a teaching agrees with revealed doctrine or disagrees with it; and a question of fact, whether such a verbal formula or, in the case of Jansenius, such a book contains a teaching of this kind," p. 318.
