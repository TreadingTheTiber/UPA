## Pars II, Disputatio II, Articulus IV, Sectio II De factis dogmaticis

In particular, **the Church is infallible in judging dogmatic facts**, and **this must be held at least as theologically certain**.

1.\ What is a dogmatic fact? — In itself, any revealed fact can be called dogmatic; however, after the controversy arose with the Jansenists, that term assumed a particular meaning, such that, with respect to revelation, a threefold species of facts is distinguished: facts *directly and properly revealed*, e.g., the resurrection of Christ, the conversion of Paul, which are themselves so many dogmas and the most certain object of infallibility; other facts are *merely historical*, which are neither revealed nor enter into any connection with revealed truths. Finally, there exist **facts more strictly called dogmatic**, namely those which, although they are not revealed, are nevertheless so connected with revelation that **they cannot be called into doubt without some revealed truth or dogma being endangered**. Of this kind are, for example, that the text of Scripture as we use it is genuine, that certain councils are truly ecumenical, **that Pius X is the legitimate successor of St. Peter**, etc.

2.\ And these dogmatic facts are divided into two classes: dogmatic facts *in a more general sense* or *simply* such, and dogmatic facts *in a stricter sense* or *dogmatic texts*. A dogmatic fact *in the strict sense* is a *doctrinal fact*, which concerns whether in some book a certain heretical or *orthodox sense is found*.[^1] These, therefore, are found in books or texts of human origin, which nevertheless treat of revealed matters and are consequently either consonant with or opposed to the deposit of faith. Thus indeed books or texts can be distinguished as being of three kinds: *sacred or inspired, merely profane, dogmatic*.

[...]

[^1]: The distinction lies especially in this: that the *former facts* concern the physical or moral person from whom the doctrine of faith proceeds, while the *latter concern the signs* by which the doctrine is expressed. Hence the *former are* connected with revelation by a nexus of certitude or manifestation, insofar as when these are denied, revealed truths are rendered uncertain; **thus when the legitimacy of the pontiff is called into doubt, his definitions can no longer be retained with certainty as defined truths**. The *latter are* connected with revealed truths by a nexus of signification or truth, not of certitude alone; for if the Church were to repudiate those things which are in fact in conformity with revelation, it would already betray the truth itself; cf. Palmieri *de rom. pont.* § 21 n. V.
