| **ARTICULUS III.** | | **ARTICLE III.** |
| *An sit de fide Pium VI. jam Sedentem esse Ecclesiae universalis Pastorem?* | | *Whether it is a matter of faith that Pius VI, currently seated, is the Pastor of the universal Church?* |
| NEgant aliqui, volentes esse quidem de fide legitimum Petri Successorem esse Papam, sed nolentes esse de fide hunc hominem, v. gr. Pium VI. esse summum Pontificem; quia non est de fide esse canonice electum, cum hoc non sit revelatum. | | Some deny this, willing to accept as a matter of faith that the legitimate Successor of Peter is the Pope, but unwilling to accept as a matter of faith that this particular man, e.g., Pius VI, is the Supreme Pontiff; because it is not a matter of faith that he was canonically elected, since this has not been revealed. |
| **CONCL. UNIC.** De fide est Pium VI. legitime electum, & ut talem ab Ecclesia acceptatum esse verum Papam. Ita communissime Theologi. | | **SOLE CONCLUSION.** It is a matter of faith that Pius VI was legitimately elected, and as such, having been accepted by the Church, is the true Pope. This is the most common opinion among Theologians. |
| **Prob. I.** Ex Conc. Constantiensi sess. ult. ubi decernit Martinus V. ut ab iis, qui de haeresi ad fidem revertuntur, petatur inter alia: *Utrum credant, quod Papa canonice electus, qui pro tempore fuerit, ejus nomine proprio expresso, sit successor B. Petri habens supremam auctoritatem in Ecclesia Dei?* Ergo supponit esse articulum fidei: cum haeresim abjurantes nonnisi de fidei veritatibus interrogentur. | | **Proof I.** From the Council of Constance, final session, where Martin V decrees that those who return to the faith from heresy should be asked among other things: *"Whether they believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, with his proper name expressed, is the successor of Blessed Peter having supreme authority in the Church of God?"* Therefore, it is presumed to be an article of faith: since those abjuring heresy are questioned only about truths of the faith. |
| **Prob. 2.** Illa conclusio est fidei, cujus duae praemissae sunt fidei; sed haec conclusio: *Pius VI. est verus Papa*, sequitur ex duabus praemissis de fide: ergo est fidei. Major certa est. Prob. Min. quia hae duae praemissae, ex quibus sequitur dicta conclusio, *omnis in Papam legitime electus & ut talis ab Ecclesia receptus, est verus Papa; sed Pius VI. est talis*, sunt fidei; Major quidem, de qua nulli dubitant Catholici; alias non esset de fide legitimum Petri successorem esse verum Papam: Minor vero, quia eo ipso quo Ecclesia ipsum recipit ut legitime electum revelat Deus ipsius electionem esse legitimam, cum promiserit Christus numquam Ecclesiam suam erraturam in materia fidei: erraret autem in tali materia, si non staret conclusio, quandoquidem agnoscens electum ut Papam, ipsum agnoscat ut fidei regulam infallibilem, qui tunc esset fallibilis. | | **Problem 2.** That conclusion is of faith whose two premises are of faith; but this conclusion: *Pius VI is the true Pope*, follows from two premises of faith: therefore it is of faith. The major premise is certain. The minor is proven, because these two premises, from which the said conclusion follows, *everyone legitimately elected as Pope and received as such by the Church is the true Pope; but Pius VI is such*, are of faith; The major premise indeed, which no Catholics doubt; otherwise it would not be of faith that the legitimate successor of Peter is the true Pope: The minor premise, however, because by the very fact that the Church receives him as legitimately elected, God reveals that his election is legitimate, since Christ promised that His Church would never err in matters of faith: but it would err in such a matter if the conclusion did not stand, since by recognizing the elected person as Pope, it recognizes him as an infallible rule of faith, who would then be fallible. |
| **Confirm.** Haec minor; eo ipso quo Deus per invocationem alicujus Confessoris, vel Martyris, aut per venerationem ipsius reliquiarum, facit miraculum evidens, ita ut de illo nullatenus possit dubitari, revelat implicite ipsum mortuum esse in gratia, quia repugnat sanctitati divinae facere miracula ad invocationem damnati: ergo eo ipso quo Ecclesia, quam Deus dixit esse *columnam & firmamentum veritatis*, 1. Tim. 3. acceptat electum, ut Pontificem, adeoque ut fidei regulam infallibilem, revelat Deus implicite electionem ipsius esse legitimam; quia repugnat divinae fidelitati ut permittat Ecclesiam errare, quam promisit non erraturam. | | **Confirm.** This minor premise: by the very fact that God performs an evident miracle through the invocation of some Confessor or Martyr, or through the veneration of his relics, such that it can in no way be doubted, He implicitly reveals that this deceased person was in a state of grace, because it is repugnant to divine holiness to perform miracles at the invocation of one who is damned. Therefore, by the very fact that the Church, which God called the *pillar and foundation of truth* (1 Timothy 3), accepts the elected person as Pontiff, and thus as an infallible rule of faith, God implicitly reveals that his election is legitimate; because it is repugnant to divine fidelity to permit the Church to err, which He promised would not err. |
| **Prob. 3.** Si non esset de fide Papam regnantem esse Summum Pontificem, possemus dubitare, an sit Petri successor, an sit fidei regula infallibilis, & consequenter an omnes fidei definitiones sint legitimae, adeoque nihil teneremur credere tamquam revelatum, ob Ecclesiae propositionem; atqui hoc est absurdum: ergo & illud. | | **Proof 3.** If it were not a matter of faith that the reigning Pope is the Supreme Pontiff, we could doubt whether he is the successor of Peter, whether he is the infallible rule of faith, and consequently whether all definitions of faith are legitimate, and thus we would not be bound to believe anything as revealed on the Church's proposition; but this is absurd: therefore, so is the former. |
| **Dices:** Ubi legitime delegatus annuntiat nobis fidei veritates, tenemur illas credere tamquam de fide, licet tantum fide humana credamus esse legitime delegatum: ergo licet tantum fide humana crederemus Pium VI. esse Papam, teneremur credere fide divina veritatibus revelatis ab ipso propositis. | | **You will say:** When a legitimately delegated person announces to us truths of faith, we are bound to believe them as matters of faith, although we believe only with human faith that he is legitimately delegated. Therefore, although we might believe only with human faith that Pius VI is Pope, we would be bound to believe with divine faith the revealed truths proposed by him. |
| **Resp.** Disparitatem esse, quod non credamus veritatibus Ã  delegato propositis, ex ipsius auctoritate, sed quia proponit motiva credibilitatis sufficientia; credamus autem Papae definienti, ex ipsius auctoritate; & consequenter aliter credere debemus Papae, aliter delegato; Papae propter auctoritatem, delegato propter motiva credibilitatis. | | **Response:** There is a disparity, for we do not believe the truths proposed by a delegate on his own authority, but because he presents sufficient motives of credibility; whereas we believe the Pope when he defines, on his own authority; and consequently we should believe the Pope differently than we believe a delegate; we believe the Pope because of his authority, and a delegate because of the motives of credibility. |
| **Prob. 4.** Non potest Ecclesia recipere aliquid tamquam de fide, quod non est tale, alias erraret in materia fidei; sed Papae definitiones in hac materia recipit tamquam fidei articulos: ergo sunt de fide. Subsumo: Atqui non potest illos credere de fide, ex Papae proponentis auctoritate, si liceat ipsi de Papae auctoritate dubitare: ergo. | | **Proof 4:** The Church cannot receive something as a matter of faith that is not such, otherwise it would err in matters of faith; but the Church receives the Pope's definitions in this matter as articles of faith: therefore they are of faith. I further argue: But the Church cannot believe these to be of faith, on the authority of the Pope who proposes them, if it is permitted to doubt the Pope's authority: therefore. |
| **Obji. 1.** Haec propositio: Pius VI. est verus Papa, non est in Scriptura explicite, aut implicite: ergo non est de fide. | | **Objection 1:** This proposition: "Pius VI is the true Pope," is not explicitly or implicitly in Scripture: therefore it is not a matter of faith. |
| **Resp. Neg. Ant.** Quia continetur in hoc, quod Ecclesia numquam sit erratura in materia fidei, nec consequenter quando credat Pium VI. fidei regulam infallibilem, adeoque Papam legitimum, cum non sit talis regula, nisi quia verus Papa. Deinde esto nullatenus contineretur in Scriptura, censeretur tamen revelari eo ipso, quo Ecclesia indefectibilis electum agnoscit, ut Summum Pontificem. | | **Response: I deny the antecedent.** Because it is contained in this, that the Church will never err in matters of faith, nor consequently when it believes Pius VI to be the infallible rule of faith, and therefore the legitimate Pope, since he would not be such a rule unless he were the true Pope. Furthermore, even if it were in no way contained in Scripture, it would nevertheless be considered revealed by the very fact that the indefectible Church acknowledges the one elected as the Supreme Pontiff. |
| **Obji. 2.** Non esse de fide electionem Pii VI. esse legitimam: ergo non est de fide quod sit Summus Pontifex. | | **Objection 2:** It is not a matter of faith that the election of Pius VI is legitimate: therefore it is not a matter of faith that he is the Supreme Pontiff. |
| **Resp. N. Ant.** Cum enim non sit Pontifex legitimus, nisi per legitimam electionem, eo ipso quo revelatur & legitimum esse Pontificem, revelatur & legitimam esse ipsius electionem, ubi via electionis creatur. Non est tamen de fide quod Cardinales, qui ipsum elegerunt, sint veri Cardinales, quod habuerint intentionem eligendi, quod formam juris servaverint &c. quia illa utpote remote, & tantum praerequisita non videntur esse objectum fidei. | | **Reply of N. Ant.** Since one is not a legitimate Pontiff except through legitimate election, by the very fact that it is revealed that someone is a legitimate Pontiff, it is also revealed that his election is legitimate, when he is created through the way of election. Nevertheless, it is not a matter of faith that the Cardinals who elected him are true Cardinals, or that they had the intention of electing, or that they observed the form of law, etc., because these things, insofar as they are remote and only prerequisite, do not seem to be objects of faith. |
| **Obji. 3.** Non est revelatum Papam regnantem esse valide baptizatum: ergo nec est revelatum esse vere Papam, cum solus baptizatus sit capax supremae illius dignitatis. | | **Objection 3.** It is not revealed that the reigning Pope is validly baptized; therefore, neither is it revealed that he is truly Pope, since only a baptized person is capable of that supreme dignity. |
| **Respondent aliqui Neg. Ant.** Quia eo ipso quo revelat Deus esse legitimum Papam, etiam implicite revelat habere omnia ad Papatum necessario requisita. Sed   | | **Some respond by denying the antecedent.** Because by the very fact that God reveals someone to be a legitimate Pope, He also implicitly reveals that he has all the necessary prerequisites for the Papacy. But |
| **Resp. Concesso Ant.** (si saltem intelligatur de revelatione immediata.) N. Conseq. Quia ut sit de fide Pium esse Papam, sufficit quod sit certum theologice esse baptizatum; jam autem licet Deus revelando Papam modernum esse legitimum, non revelet proprie esse baptizatum, dat tamen nobis locum id inferendi per conclusionem Theologicam, cum sit necessario praerequisitum. | | **I respond by conceding the antecedent** (if at least it is understood concerning immediate revelation), but deny the consequent. Because for it to be a matter of faith that Pius is Pope, it suffices that it is theologically certain that he is baptized; now, although God, by revealing that the modern Pope is legitimate, does not properly reveal that he is baptized, He nevertheless gives us ground to infer this through theological conclusion, since it is a necessary prerequisite. |
| **Obji. 4.** Non esset haereticus qui diceret, Pius VI. non est Papa legitimus: ergo non est de fide esse talem. | | **Objection 4.** One who would say, "Pius VI is not a legitimate Pope," would not be a heretic; therefore, it is not a matter of faith that he is such. |
| **Resp. Dist. Ant.** Non esset haereticus qui hoc diceret ante Ecclesiae acceptationem: C. post acceptationem, subdistinguo, & teneret nostram sententiam: N. & teneret oppositam: C. quia bona fide, ob rationes visas sibi sufficientes, crederet non esse articulum fidei. Sed nihil inde contra nos. | | **Response, I distinguish the antecedent.** One who would say this before the Church's acceptance would not be a heretic: I concede. After acceptance, I further distinguish: if he held our position: I deny. If he held the opposite view: I concede, because in good faith, due to reasons that seemed sufficient to him, he would believe it not to be an article of faith. But this proves nothing against our position. |
| **Obji. 5.** Licet sit de fide Christum esse in Eucharistia: non est tamen de fide esse in hac numero hostia: ergo licet sit de fide verum Petri successorem esse Papam, non est tamen de fide hunc numero hominem esse Papam. | | **Objection 5.** Although it is a matter of faith that Christ is present in the Eucharist, it is nevertheless not a matter of faith that He is present in this particular host. Therefore, although it is a matter of faith that the true successor of Peter is the Pope, it is not a matter of faith that this particular man is the Pope. |
| **Resp. Neg. Conseq.** Disparitas est, quod nullatenus sit revelatum Christum esse in hac hostia, licet putetur consecrata: revelatum sit autem hunc hominem esse Papam, eo ipso quo per Ecclesiam indefectibilem agnoscitur & recipitur ut talis, sicut ostendimus antea. | | **Response, I deny the consequence.** The disparity lies in the fact that it is in no way revealed that Christ is present in this host, even though it is believed to be consecrated; however, it is revealed that this man is the Pope, by the very fact that he is acknowledged and received as such by the indefectible Church, as we have shown previously. |
