## Tractatus II, Disp. II, Quaes. IV, Art. III

*Whether it is a matter of faith that Pius VI, currently seated, is the Pastor of the universal Church?*

Some deny this, willing to accept as a matter of faith that the legitimate Successor of Peter is the Pope, but unwilling to accept as a matter of faith that this particular man, e.g., Pius VI, is the Supreme Pontiff; because it is not a matter of faith that he was canonically elected, since this has not been revealed.

**SOLE CONCLUSION. It is a matter of faith that Pius VI was legitimately elected, and as such, having been accepted by the Church, is the true Pope. This is the most common opinion among Theologians.**

**Proof I.** From the Council of Constance, final session, where Martin V decrees that those who return to the faith from heresy should be asked among other things: *"Whether they believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, with his proper name expressed, is the successor of Blessed Peter having supreme authority in the Church of God?"* Therefore, it is presumed to be an article of faith: since those abjuring heresy are questioned only about truths of the faith.

**Problem 2.** That conclusion is of faith whose two premises are of faith; but this conclusion: *Pius VI is the true Pope*, follows from two premises of faith: therefore it is of faith. The major premise is certain. The minor is proven, because these two premises, from which the said conclusion follows, *everyone legitimately elected as Pope and received as such by the Church is the true Pope; but Pius VI is such*, are of faith; The major premise indeed, which no Catholics doubt; otherwise it would not be of faith that the legitimate successor of Peter is the true Pope: The minor premise, however, because by the very fact that the Church receives him as legitimately elected, God reveals that his election is legitimate, since Christ promised that His Church would never err in matters of faith: but it would err in such a matter if the conclusion did not stand, since by recognizing the elected person as Pope, it recognizes him as an infallible rule of faith, who would then be fallible.

**Confirm.** This minor premise: by the very fact that God performs an evident miracle through the invocation of some Confessor or Martyr, or through the veneration of his relics, such that it can in no way be doubted, He implicitly reveals that this deceased person was in a state of grace, because it is repugnant to divine holiness to perform miracles at the invocation of one who is damned. **Therefore, by the very fact that the Church, which God called the *pillar and foundation of truth* (1 Timothy 3), accepts the elected person as Pontiff, and thus as an infallible rule of faith, God implicitly reveals that his election is legitimate; because it is repugnant to divine fidelity to permit the Church to err, which He promised would not err.**

**Proof 3.** If it were not a matter of faith that the reigning Pope is the Supreme Pontiff, we could doubt whether he is the successor of Peter, whether he is the infallible rule of faith, and consequently whether all definitions of faith are legitimate, and thus we would not be bound to believe anything as revealed on the Church's proposition; but this is absurd: therefore, so is the former.

**You will say:** When a legitimately delegated person announces to us truths of faith, we are bound to believe them as matters of faith, although we believe only with human faith that he is legitimately delegated. Therefore, although we might believe only with human faith that Pius VI is Pope, we would be bound to believe with divine faith the revealed truths proposed by him.

**Response:** There is a disparity, for we do not believe the truths proposed by a delegate on his own authority, but because he presents sufficient motives of credibility; whereas we believe the Pope when he defines, on his own authority; and consequently we should believe the Pope differently than we believe a delegate; we believe the Pope because of his authority, and a delegate because of the motives of credibility.

**Proof 4:** The Church cannot receive something as a matter of faith that is not such, otherwise it would err in matters of faith; but the Church receives the Pope's definitions in this matter as articles of faith: therefore they are of faith. I further argue: But the Church cannot believe these to be of faith, on the authority of the Pope who proposes them, if it is permitted to doubt the Pope's authority: therefore.
