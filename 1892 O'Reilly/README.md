## Chapter 24, The Council of Constance (cont.)

By way of reply to the argument contained in this passage, I make the following observations. (1) The See was vacant by the removal of whoever was the *true* Pope, whichever was the man. The *certainty* of the vacancy depended on the operation of causes sufficient to remove each of the three in case he happened to be the true Pope. One, as Mr. Gladstone says, *resigned*; that was Gregory. Two were deposed. Of these, John, who was most likely true Pope up to that time, *accepted his own deposition*, and thus *equivalently resigned*; though, even if he had not, he could have been set aside as doubtful. The other, Benedict, was, at the best, a doubtful Pope, and consequently could be deposed by the highest authority that existed in the Church under the circumstances, since there *must be a* way of getting rid of a doubtful Pope. Whatever power the Council had of deposing a Pope did not depend on any definition or declaration, nor does Mr. Gladstone say it did, but, as he does say, *on a principle*, and so far he is right. But when he says this was the principle involved in the Decree of the fifth session, he unintentionally confuses the matter. For the Decree might involve something more than the principle on which the power of the Council rested. Thus, the principle might regard a doubtful Pope, or a case of schism, and the Decree *might* include a certain Pope outside of a case of schism, and then the principle would be right and the Decree wrong. (2) The principle on which the Council's action depended, so far as this affected the validity of Martin's election, did not need *his* recognition, nor could such recognition give it certainty, were it previously doubtful; for, if *it* was not sound, *he* was not Pope. If he had *denied* the principle, he would have compromised his own position. But omitting to affirm is not denying; and yet Mr. Gladstone seems to imply that it is, or, at any rate, if it is not, his argument falls to the ground. (3) Whatever power the Council had of deposing a Pope did not and could not come from a Pope, nor depend on his confirmation or recognition. It was a singular, abnormal power which accrued to that Council in special circumstances, and would accrue to another Council in similar circumstances. It may be said, no doubt, that a definition of the Pope and Council dogmatically affirming such a power would give the doctrine a new *status* for the future. But the Council of Constance, as we have seen, did not frame such a definition. It proposed nothing *to be believed* on the subject. **As to Pope Martin's right to his position, his universal acceptance by the Catholic Church settled that; and the universality of this acceptance was not appreciably affected by the obstinate persistence of Peter de Luna with a handful of adherents.**
