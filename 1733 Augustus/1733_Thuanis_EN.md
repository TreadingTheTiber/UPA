**XV.** According to the solemn custom of attacking the Turks—or rather, of exercising the knights who had taken the name of Christian soldiery—Ferdinand, Grand Duke of Tuscany, had equipped triremes which[^1] have their station at Livorno, where there is a large number of assembled Jews. Rumor had been spread as if[^2] Euboea were to be attacked, but in truth the purpose was that he might make an unexpected assault and destroy by fire the triremes which had wintered at[^3] Caesarea Julia on the opposite[^4] African coast, almost neglected—as he had learned through the report of an English merchant—and that he might thus destroy them by fire. He hoped that by this action terror could be struck into the enemy, that their strength would be considerably broken, and that the sea could be made secure from piratical raids. But when the matter was revealed through the greatest treachery by the Jewish residents, the effort was for the most part frustrated; although some ships were burned, the rest of the fleet was saved.

**XVI.** At Rome, eighteen men of outstanding dignity were co-opted into the College of Cardinals in greater number than before, all at one time, and among them[^5] Serafino Oliviero, a man to be compared with few in learning and moral integrity, the natural son of Francesco[^6] Olivieri, who held the highest dignity of the civil magistracy among us with great distinction—a fact which had been unknown until now; it was only established that he[^7] was born at Lyon in France, and afterwards[^8] educated at Bologna, since his mother was from a Bolognese family: so that since he was reckoned a hybrid among the Italians, he owed the favor of his co-optation to both Italy and France. Certainly the Pontiff wished it to be believed that this was a tribute to the recommendation of the Most Christian King, although he had abundantly merited it otherwise through a long life spent honorably in that court and by his own virtue. In the same co-optation was chosen Giacomo[^9] Davy Du Perron, a man unknown to no one because of his outstanding learning; and Friar Anselmo Marzato of Monopoli, raised in the poverty of the Capuchins, after he had long excused himself in vain and said that such splendor was hardly suitable for a life of obscurity, was adorned with the same dignity, although unwillingly. Nor was the papal court free from the most serious contentions, as if spirits were wantonly indulging themselves in leisure; for trusting either in their learning or in the authority by which they prevail greatly everywhere, members of the Jesuit order at an inopportune time proposed several questions which furnished matter for great agitation of minds not only at Rome, but wherever the domain of legitimate succession and doctrine extends; and among these, that to believe Clement VIII, who now sits at Rome, to be the legitimate successor of blessed Peter, is not among the articles of faith: which, had not the ambassador Filippo intervened, would have brought no small danger to the entire Society. Then also that confession, which is held among the sacraments of the Church, and which therefore ought to be performed with the greatest reverence, can be accomplished by letter and through messengers. These questions at their origin were not only rejected with great consensus, but were most prudently extinguished immediately. A third exercised the minds of many for a longer time, proposed by Luis de Molina, concerning the grace of God cooperating in us with free will unto salvation; in which, since he seemed to attribute more to man than to God, he had as his greatest adversaries the rival Dominicans, who defended the teaching of blessed Augustine, received in the Church, who disputed so profoundly and in so many writings on this matter with the Pelagians. And so Francisco Suárez, a theologian of great name among them, was summoned from Spain for assistance, and finally, scarcely after very many writings published from both sides, with an interpretation added from the words of the Council of Trent, in which however the question had by no means been treated, the controversy was so settled by the most prudent Pontiff that he showed he would have preferred it had not been raised from the beginning, and in deciding it he wished nothing to be detracted from the reputation of those who had raised it. There was also action at that time concerning the co-optation of Ignatius of Loyola into the number of the blessed by sacred ceremony; but without success, because at the same time the sacred Milanese order was pressing more urgently for Cardinal Carlo Borromeo to be honored with the same honor: and since this is customarily done rarely, it is scarcely possible that the same prerogative, which they already enjoy in heaven, should be granted on earth to two simultaneously.

Judges were appointed by the pontiff to inquire more thoroughly into the case of Borromeo with additional proofs collected, further investigation of Loyola being set aside. Around that time an unexpected matter occurred which came within a hair's breadth of utterly destroying the deep peace of the city. A certain malefactor, whom the urban magistrate was pursuing, having no other refuge, entered through the back door into the residence of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese as into an asylum; the noble servants, in order to protect either the sanctity or the privilege of the place, immediately received him and concealed him, having driven away[^10] the officers at the entrance. When[^11] the urban prefect, considering this to pertain to an injury against the pontiff, wished to use force, the Farnese party, deeming this likewise to regard an injury not only to themselves but to the entire college, took up arms and called upon friends from the Roman nobility for assistance; among whom the Duke of Gaeta immediately appeared, and the ambassador Philip, who judged it to pertain to the insult of his master that men of such dignity, who rest under the protection of the Spanish, should not be afflicted with so grave an injury in his sight. These men, prepared in arms for the worst, spent the night in the cardinal's residence; he, fearing worse things, in the morning withdrew to his fortress of Caprarola, built with royal magnificence by his uncle Alexander thirty-six miles from the city, with a great armed retinue: by which action the pontiff, interpreting the injury as doubled, immediately sent the urban prefect to demand[^12] from him the prefecture of Latium, which his ancestors had always held from the times of Paul III, and from which he had rendered himself unworthy by his own contumacy. When he made excuses, upon the report of the matter the Duke of Parma, who had the pontiff's niece in marriage, suddenly flew to Rome and obtained from the pontiff, who had already enrolled one hundred Corsicans and two hundred mounted arquebusiers extraordinary for the protection of the city, that the cardinal's brother might return to the city with his good grace, and prostrate himself as a suppliant at his feet with certain hope of pardon. When he came and performed the pontiff's service as had been agreed, while[^13] returning home from the Quirinal Hill, received at his approach by the festive voices of the Roman people wishing the Farnese well, he renewed the resentment among the pontiff's intimates, and especially Cardinal Aldobrandini; who for that reason retained the enrolled soldiers even after the reconciliation, and ordered them to stand guard in the Vatican, the sense of injury being suppressed for the time, every occasion for whose avenging was removed by the mild character of the pontiff and the death that followed shortly after.
