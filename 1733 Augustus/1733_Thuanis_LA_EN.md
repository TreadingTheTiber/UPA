| **XV.** SOLEMNI more infestandorum Turcorum, aut potius exercendorum equitum, qui Christianae militiae nomen dederunt, Ferdinandus magnus Etruriae dux triremes instruxerat, quae[^1]Liburni stationem habent, ubi multus convenarum Judaeorum numerus; fama sparsa quasi[^2]Euboea peteretur, re vera ut triremes, quae ad[^3]Caesaream Juliam in opposita[^4]Africae ora hyemaverant, fere neglectas, quod Angli institoris indicio cognoverat, necopinato aggressus incendio deleret. Qua re terrorem hosti injici, et robur ejus non mediocriter infringi, et mare a piraticis excursionibus securum praestari posse sperabat. Sed re ab hospitibus Judaeis summa perfidia detecta, conatus majorem partem irritus, aliquot exustis navigiis, reliqua classe salva. | | **XV.** According to the solemn custom of attacking the Turks—or rather, of exercising the knights who had taken the name of Christian soldiery—Ferdinand, Grand Duke of Tuscany, had equipped triremes which[^1] have their station at Livorno, where there is a large number of assembled Jews. Rumor had been spread as if[^2] Euboea were to be attacked, but in truth the purpose was that he might make an unexpected assault and destroy by fire the triremes which had wintered at[^3] Caesarea Julia on the opposite[^4] African coast, almost neglected—as he had learned through the report of an English merchant—and that he might thus destroy them by fire. He hoped that by this action terror could be struck into the enemy, that their strength would be considerably broken, and that the sea could be made secure from piratical raids. But when the matter was revealed through the greatest treachery by the Jewish residents, the effort was for the most part frustrated; although some ships were burned, the rest of the fleet was saved. |
| **XVI.** ROMAE in collegium cardinalium majore numero quam antea, una vice, cooptati XVIII dignitate praestantes viri, et in iis[^5]Seraphinus Olivarius literis et morum candore cum paucis comparandus, Francisci[^6]Olivarii, qui summam togae dignitatem magna cum laude apud nos tenuit, naturalis filius, quod hactenus ignoratum fuit; tantum constabat eum[^7]Lugduni in Gallia natum, et postea[^8]Bononiae educatum, matre quippe domo Bononiensi: ita ut cum hybrida inter Italos censeretur, cooptationi suae gratiam tam Italiae quam Galliae deberet. Certe pontifex hoc regis Christianissimi commendationi tributum credi voluit, quod ille alioqui longa vita honorifice in illa aula peracta, et propria virtute abunde meruerat. Eadem cooptatione lectus Jacobus[^9]David Perronius eximia sua doctrina nemini ignotus; et F. Anselmus [^k]Marzatus Monopolitanus in tenuitate Capucinorum educatus, cum se diu frustra excusasset, et splendorem illum vitae latenti minime convenire diceret, eadem dignitate, quamquam invitus, est ornatus. Nec vacua a contentionibus gravissimis, quasi per otium lascivientibus animis, aula fuit; nam fiducia seu doctrinae, seu, qua plurimum ubique pollent, auctoritatis, Jesuitici sodales alieno tempore aliquot quaestiones proposuerunt, quae magnae animorum commotioni non solum Romae, sed quacumque legitimae successionis et doctrinae patet ditio, materiam praebuerunt; et inter eas, Clementem VIII, qui nunc Romae sedet, credere legitimum beati Petri successorem, non esse ex articulis fidei: quod nisi Philippicus orator intervenisset, toti societati periculum non mediocre importabat. Deinde etiam confessionem, quae inter ecclesiae sacramenta habetur, et quae proinde praecipua cum reverentia exerceri debet, per epistolam et per cursores peragi posse. Quae quaestiones in ortu suo non solum magno consensu rejectae, verum prudentissime statim extinctae sunt. Tertia diutius multorum ingenia exercuit, a Ludovico Molina proposita, de gratia Dei cum libero arbitrio in nobis ad salutem cooperante; in qua cum plus homini quam Deo tribuere videretur, summos adversarios habuit Dominicanos aemulos, qui beati Augustini, qui cum Pelagianis ea de re tam profunde et tot scriptis disputavit, sententiam in ecclesia receptam tuebantur. Itaque subsidio evocatus ex Hispania Franciscus Suares magni nominis inter eos theologus, et vix tandem post complura hinc inde publicata scripta, ex Concilii Tridentini verbis, in quo tamen quaestio minime agitata fuerat, interpretatione adjecta, a prudentissimo pontifice controversia ita composita est, ut eam non motam ab initio optasse ostenderet, et in ea decidenda nihil existimationi illorum, qui eam moverant, detractum vellet. Actum et tunc de Ignatio Loiola in beatorum numerum sacra ceremonia cooptando; sed nullo successu, quod eodem tempore de Carolo Borromaeo cardinali instantius codem eodem honore adficiendo a sacro ordine Mediolanensi ageretur: et cum id raro fieri consueverit, vix est, ut duobus simul eadem praerogativa, qua jam in coelo fruuntur, in terris tribuatur. | | **XVI.** At Rome, eighteen men of outstanding dignity were co-opted into the College of Cardinals in greater number than before, all at one time, and among them[^5] Serafino Oliviero, a man to be compared with few in learning and moral integrity, the natural son of Francesco[^6] Olivieri, who held the highest dignity of the civil magistracy among us with great distinction—a fact which had been unknown until now; it was only established that he[^7] was born at Lyon in France, and afterwards[^8] educated at Bologna, since his mother was from a Bolognese family: so that since he was reckoned a hybrid among the Italians, he owed the favor of his co-optation to both Italy and France. Certainly the Pontiff wished it to be believed that this was a tribute to the recommendation of the Most Christian King, although he had abundantly merited it otherwise through a long life spent honorably in that court and by his own virtue. In the same co-optation was chosen Giacomo[^9] Davy Du Perron, a man unknown to no one because of his outstanding learning; and Friar Anselmo Marzato of Monopoli, raised in the poverty of the Capuchins, after he had long excused himself in vain and said that such splendor was hardly suitable for a life of obscurity, was adorned with the same dignity, although unwillingly. Nor was the papal court free from the most serious contentions, as if spirits were wantonly indulging themselves in leisure; for trusting either in their learning or in the authority by which they prevail greatly everywhere, members of the Jesuit order at an inopportune time proposed several questions which furnished matter for great agitation of minds not only at Rome, but wherever the domain of legitimate succession and doctrine extends; and among these, that to believe Clement VIII, who now sits at Rome, to be the legitimate successor of blessed Peter, is not among the articles of faith: which, had not the ambassador Filippo intervened, would have brought no small danger to the entire Society. Then also that confession, which is held among the sacraments of the Church, and which therefore ought to be performed with the greatest reverence, can be accomplished by letter and through messengers. These questions at their origin were not only rejected with great consensus, but were most prudently extinguished immediately. A third exercised the minds of many for a longer time, proposed by Luis de Molina, concerning the grace of God cooperating in us with free will unto salvation; in which, since he seemed to attribute more to man than to God, he had as his greatest adversaries the rival Dominicans, who defended the teaching of blessed Augustine, received in the Church, who disputed so profoundly and in so many writings on this matter with the Pelagians. And so Francisco Suárez, a theologian of great name among them, was summoned from Spain for assistance, and finally, scarcely after very many writings published from both sides, with an interpretation added from the words of the Council of Trent, in which however the question had by no means been treated, the controversy was so settled by the most prudent Pontiff that he showed he would have preferred it had not been raised from the beginning, and in deciding it he wished nothing to be detracted from the reputation of those who had raised it. There was also action at that time concerning the co-optation of Ignatius of Loyola into the number of the blessed by sacred ceremony; but without success, because at the same time the sacred Milanese order was pressing more urgently for Cardinal Carlo Borromeo to be honored with the same honor: and since this is customarily done rarely, it is scarcely possible that the same prerogative, which they already enjoy in heaven, should be granted on earth to two simultaneously. |
| Dati a pontifice judices, qui de causa Borromaei amplius probationibus collectis quaererent, omissa de Loiola ulteriore cognitione. Sub id et inopina res incidit, quae paulum abfuit, altam urbis quietem omnino pessum dedit. Quidam maleficus, quem quaesitor urbanus persequebatur, cum aliud non haberet effugium, in Odoardi Farnesii cardinalis aedeis tanquam in Asylum per posticum ingreditur, quem domestici nobiles, ut loci sive religionem, sive privilegium tuerentur, statim receptum occultarunt, ingressu summotis[^10]latrunculatoribus. Cum[^11]praefectus urbis id ad injuriam pontificis pertinere ratus vim facere vellet, Farnesiani id pariter ad injuriam non solum suam, sed totius collegii spectare existimantes arma capiunt, et amicos ex nobilitate Romana auxilio advocant; inter quos dux Cajetanus subito adfuit, et Philippicus orator, qui ad heri sui contumeliam pertinere arbitrabatur, ne tali dignitate viri, qui in Hispanorum patrocinio conquiescunt, tam gravi injuria in conspectu suo adficerentur. Ii in armis ad extrema parati in cardinalis aedibus pernoctarunt, qui pejora metuens, mane in Caprarolam arcem suam regali magnificentia ab Alexandro patruo exstructam, XXXVI ab urbe milliariis, magno stipatu cum armis concessit: quo facto injuriam geminatam interpretatus pontifex, confestim praefectum urbis mittit, qui[^12]Latii praefecturam, quam a Pauli III temporibus semper majores sui tenuerant, et qua se ipse contumacia sua indignum reddiderat, ab eo reposceret. Cum se excusaret, ad rei famam Parmensis dux, qui pontificis neptem in matrimonio habebat, Romam subito advolat, et a pontifice, qui jam IƆC Corsos et CC scloppetarios equites extra ordinem urbis tutelae scripserat, impetravit, ut cum bona ejus gratia cardinalis frater ad urbem redire posset, seque supplicem certa veniae spe ad pedes ejus prosterneret. Cum venisset, functis pontificis officio, sicuti convenerat, defunctus, dum[^13]Quirinali monte domum redit, festis populi Romani Farnesiiis bene precantis vocibus ad occursum exceptus, invidiam apud pontificis intimos, atque adeo cardinalem Aldobrandinum renovavit; qui propterea lectum militem, etiam post reconciliationem retinuit, et in Vaticano excubare jussit, presso ad tempus injuriae sensu, cujus ulciscendae mite pontificis ingenium, et paulo post secuta mors omnem occasionem abstulit. | | Judges were appointed by the pontiff to inquire more thoroughly into the case of Borromeo with additional proofs collected, further investigation of Loyola being set aside. Around that time an unexpected matter occurred which came within a hair's breadth of utterly destroying the deep peace of the city. A certain malefactor, whom the urban magistrate was pursuing, having no other refuge, entered through the back door into the residence of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese as into an asylum; the noble servants, in order to protect either the sanctity or the privilege of the place, immediately received him and concealed him, having driven away[^10] the officers at the entrance. When[^11] the urban prefect, considering this to pertain to an injury against the pontiff, wished to use force, the Farnese party, deeming this likewise to regard an injury not only to themselves but to the entire college, took up arms and called upon friends from the Roman nobility for assistance; among whom the Duke of Gaeta immediately appeared, and the ambassador Philip, who judged it to pertain to the insult of his master that men of such dignity, who rest under the protection of the Spanish, should not be afflicted with so grave an injury in his sight. These men, prepared in arms for the worst, spent the night in the cardinal's residence; he, fearing worse things, in the morning withdrew to his fortress of Caprarola, built with royal magnificence by his uncle Alexander thirty-six miles from the city, with a great armed retinue: by which action the pontiff, interpreting the injury as doubled, immediately sent the urban prefect to demand[^12] from him the prefecture of Latium, which his ancestors had always held from the times of Paul III, and from which he had rendered himself unworthy by his own contumacy. When he made excuses, upon the report of the matter the Duke of Parma, who had the pontiff's niece in marriage, suddenly flew to Rome and obtained from the pontiff, who had already enrolled one hundred Corsicans and two hundred mounted arquebusiers extraordinary for the protection of the city, that the cardinal's brother might return to the city with his good grace, and prostrate himself as a suppliant at his feet with certain hope of pardon. When he came and performed the pontiff's service as had been agreed, while[^13] returning home from the Quirinal Hill, received at his approach by the festive voices of the Roman people wishing the Farnese well, he renewed the resentment among the pontiff's intimates, and especially Cardinal Aldobrandini; who for that reason retained the enrolled soldiers even after the reconciliation, and ordered them to stand guard in the Vatican, the sense of injury being suppressed for the time, every occasion for whose avenging was removed by the mild character of the pontiff and the death that followed shortly after. |
