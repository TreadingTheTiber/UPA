## Tractatus Decimus, Disputatio Quarta, Articulus IV

[...]

**Question.** *Whether, once a legitimate election of the Supreme Pontiff has been made, it is immediately and per se primarily a matter of faith that this person in particular, for example Innocent XI, is truly the Pontiff?*

## §. I. *With certain premises having been set forth, the opinions are reported.*

I suppose first that something can be said to be of divine faith in two ways, namely either immediately, or formally, or only mediately, or virtually. **That is said to be of divine faith immediately which is immediately revealed by God; mediately, however, that which is evidently inferred from one proposition immediately revealed by God, and from another known by natural light.**

I suppose second that the difficulty proposed in the title is not about a Supreme Pontiff whose election the Church has declared to be null, nor about one whose election is doubtful and not yet determined, but about a Supreme Pontiff whom the Church has declared to have been legitimately elected, by accepting him as Supreme Pontiff. **Concerning that Pontiff therefore who has been legitimately elected and accepted by the Church, such as now is Innocent XI happily governing the Church, we inquire whether it is immediately and per se primarily a matter of faith that he is truly the Pontiff and head of the Church.**

Among the Thomists, Torquemada, Cano, and Báñez appear to hold the negative position; and outside the School of Saint Thomas, Alfonso de Castro expressly teaches that, *although we are bound to believe by faith that the true successor of Christ is the supreme Pastor of the entire Church, nevertheless we are not bound by the same faith to believe that Leo or Clement is the true successor of Peter*, so that one who would deny this *ought not to be called a heretic, but a schismatic.*

The affirmative opinion is nevertheless more common among Theologians, and among the Thomists it is expressly taught by John of St. Thomas and by Dominic of the Holy Trinity. Some of this school hold that it becomes a matter of faith only from the time when the one accepted as Supreme Pontiff begins to exercise acts proper to the Supreme Pontiff, such as definitive judgments in matters of faith; **others, more commonly, hold that immediately when he is accepted by the Church as Supreme Pontiff, it is immediately a matter of faith that he is the true Pope.**

## §. II. *The true opinion is established by a twofold conclusion.*

**I say first: It is established by divine faith that the Roman Pontiff existing for the time being is the legitimate successor of Peter and the true Vicar of Christ, when he defines something to be believed by divine faith.**

It is proven: When the Pontiff defines something to be believed by divine faith, **it is itself of faith that he then has the power of defining and the infallible assistance of the Holy Spirit; therefore it is also then established by divine faith that he is the true Pontiff.** Such power and assistance is given only to the true Pontiff, to whom alone it is promised in the person of Peter and of his legitimate successors, according to those words of Christ: *You are Peter* (Matt. 16); *I have prayed for you* (Luke 22); *Feed my sheep* (John 21). For when the Pontiff defines something as to be held of faith, **it is impossible that we should believe by faith that object as defined, and not believe that the definition itself is legitimate, and consequently that the one defining has here and now infallible authority and assistance of the Holy Spirit.**

This reasoning is confirmed and more clearly illustrated: When the Pontiff defines something to be believed by divine faith, by that very act he proposes himself as the rule of our faith. Therefore it is then established by divine faith that he is the true Pontiff. For the Pontiff, by defining something pertaining to faith, proposes himself as the legitimate judge of controversies of faith, and consequently as the true rule of the doctrine of our faith. **When something is a rule of faith, it must be no less credible through faith that it is a rule than that what is determined and regulated through it is of the faith;** just as, when some book of Scripture is proposed as canonical, not only is everything contained in it of the faith, but **it is likewise of the faith that such a book is canonical and received through God's revelation,** without which we could never be certain of the things defined and handed down in Sacred Scripture. **Therefore, if when the Pontiff defines something to be believed by divine faith he thereby proposes himself as the rule of our faith, it must also pertain to the same divine faith, as something credible through it, that he is the true Pontiff.**

You may say: Although the preachers of the Gospel propose to us things of faith to be believed, nevertheless we are not bound by faith to believe that they are legitimate preachers of the Gospel. Therefore likewise, although the Pontiff proposes to us something of faith to be believed, we are not bound by divine faith to believe that he is the true Pontiff and legitimate Vicar of Christ and successor of Peter, but it suffices that we have human faith and moral certitude concerning this.

But on the contrary: **This distinction exists between the Supreme Pontiff proposing things of faith to be believed by his definition, and the evangelical minister preaching them, that the latter does not constitute himself as a determinative rule of things of faith, but only as a minister announcing and declaring what is to be believed; whereas the Supreme Pontiff proposes things to be believed as the animate rule of faith and as supreme judge determining what is to be believed, so that by his authority the faithful are obliged to believe.** Hence it is necessary that they believe, not with moral certitude alone (under which something absolutely false can lie), but truly also with the certitude of faith, that **this particular Pontiff existing for the time and ruling the Church is the true Pontiff and legitimate Vicar of Christ and successor of Peter.**

**I say secondly: It is of faith, even immediately, that this man in particular, for example Innocent XI, is the true Pope, not only from that time when he determined something concerning faith and proposed it to the Church for belief, but also from that time when the Church declared his election to have been valid.**

It is proved firstly: **From that time it is immediately of faith that this man in particular is the true rule of our faith, and consequently the true Pope, from which time he has been accepted by the Church as such a rule.** But from the time when his election is declared valid by the Church, he is accepted by it as the rule of our faith. Therefore from that time it is immediately of faith that he is the true Pope. The minor premise is evident, but the major premise is proved thus: **it is also immediately of faith that the Church cannot err in accepting the rule of our faith, for otherwise it would not be immediately of faith that it is consequently indefectible in accepting matters of faith regulated through such a rule.** Therefore, from the time when the Church accepts this particular man as the rule of our faith, it is also immediately of faith that he is truly such a rule.

It is proved secondly: We believe by faith that this Church in which we now are is the true and perfect Church; but once a peaceful election has been made and accepted, that society which has not been united with its visible head and subjected to him cannot be held to be the true and perfect Church. **Therefore it is fitting that, just as it is a matter of faith that this Church is the true and perfect Church, so it should be a matter of faith, once a legitimate election has been made, that this man to whom the Church is united as to its head is truly the head of the Church and the Supreme Pontiff.**

Nor can it be said that it is only a matter of faith that there be some visible head in the Church, but not this one determinately and in particular—*this one or that one*, confusedly and indeterminately. For just as the Church in general cannot be understood without some head in general, so neither can **this determinate Church exist without a determinate head:** this determinate Church thus includes this determinate moral head, just as this determinate physical body includes this determinate physical head. Therefore, just as one who believes that Christ has a determinate physical body cannot but simultaneously believe that Christ has a determinate physical head, so one who believes this to be a determinate Church must simultaneously believe that this Church has a determinate moral head, by which it mystically consists.

Hence in the *Bull of Martin V*, found in the Council of Constance, among those interrogations made of those suspect in faith to investigate whether they are heretics or not, this one is placed: *Whether they believe that the Pope canonically elected, whoever he may be for the time being, with his proper name expressed, is the successor of Blessed Peter, having supreme authority in the Church of God?* **These words clearly concern, not only the general truth that everyone rightly elected is Supreme Pontiff, but in particular him who for the time being is Pontiff with his proper name expressed; therefore the Pontiff supposes that it is to be believed by divine faith that this man in particular, whom the whole Church recognizes and receives as legitimately elected, is the Supreme Pontiff.**

## §. III. *Objections are resolved.*

YOU will object first: For something to be immediately of faith, it is necessary that it be immediately revealed by God. But it is not immediately revealed by God that Innocent XI is the true Pope, since no passage in Scripture nor any divine tradition mentions this proposition: *Innocent XI is the true Pope.* Therefore this is not immediately of faith.

I RESPOND, the major being conceded, by denying the minor. This truth was immediately revealed by God in that universal revelation in which, on the one hand, **God revealed that the supreme power conferred upon Peter would pass to legitimate successors**, and on the other, **that the universal Church would never err in matters of faith, since it is the pillar and foundation of truth.** In those universal propositions revealed by God **there is contained formally, as a part in the whole, this truth: that this particular Pontiff, whom the Church accepts as duly elected, is the true Pontiff.**

In order that this may be more clearly declared, and that the objection which could be made against this solution may be resolved, it must be noted with Father Dominic of the Holy Trinity that some things have been revealed by God in general so that they might be believed in general (for example, that God can do all things which do not involve contradiction), and the faithful are not bound to believe each such object in particular. **But other things God has revealed in general so that they might be believed in species and in particular, of which sort are these: Any universal Council legitimately assembled and representing the whole Church is true and obliges the faithful to receive its definitions; any Pontiff rightly elected and accepted by the Church is the true Pontiff, successor of Peter, and Vicar of Christ.** For these general revelations oblige the faithful to individual assent concerning such a Council in particular, received by the Church (for example, Nicaea or Trent), and to believing that this particular Pontiff, rightly elected and accepted by the Church (for example, Innocent XI), is the true Pontiff. **Because the acceptance of the universal Church substitutes for the collection of all individual revelations which it was not expedient for God to make; the voice of the Church is, as it were, a certain new speaking of God, or rather an explication and complement of the divine speaking, through which it is understood that God himself reveals in particular that this particular Pontiff, rightly elected and accepted, is the true Pontiff.**

You will object secondly: In order that it be immediately a matter of faith that this particular man is the true Pope, it must be certain that he is capable of such dignity. But it is not certain with infallible certitude that such a man is a subject capable of pontifical dignity, since it is not known with such certitude that he was validly baptized, especially given the obscurity of the minister's intention. Therefore it is not immediately a matter of faith that he is the true Pope.

This is confirmed: If someone who is not a Bishop is elected Pope, consequently upon his election he is consecrated as Bishop; but it is no more certain that he receives the episcopal character in such consecration than other Bishops do. Therefore, just as this is not certain with such infallible certitude concerning other Bishops, so neither is it concerning him who is elected to the Supreme Pontificate and accepted by the Church.

I respond by distinguishing the major premise: **that it be certain by faith immediately that this particular man is the true Pope, it must be certain that he is capable of such dignity with the certitude of faith**—this I deny, for such capacity pertains only by way of prerequisite and disposition so that someone may be accepted as Supreme Pontiff by the Church. With the certitude of theological consequence, I distinguish: consequently to the very acceptance by the Church it is granted; antecedently to that it is denied, for then this is certain only with moral certitude.

The solution is explained. **Before anyone is accepted by the Church as Supreme Pontiff, it is established to the Church only with moral certainty that he is a subject capable of such dignity, that he is validly baptized, and so forth; however, since this condition has a necessary connection with the proposition *One accepted by the Church as Supreme Pontiff is the true Pope*, it follows that, consequent upon the Church's acceptance, it is certain, with certainty not indeed of faith immediately but of theological conclusion, that the one accepted is truly baptized and a subject capable of pontifical dignity.** For those things which have necessary connection with a truth of faith are not indeed immediately of faith, but are correctly inferred from it by theological consequence. And thus the parity with other bishops fails, **because other bishops are not the supreme rule of faith and consequently are not accepted by the Church as such; that they be validly consecrated does not have necessary connection with a truth of faith in the way that it has necessary connection with a truth of faith that one accepted by the Church as the supreme rule of faith is or was validly consecrated as Bishop.**

You will object thirdly: One who would deny that this particular Roman Pontiff is Peter's successor, provided he did not deny that a legitimately elected one is Peter's successor, would not be a heretic but only a schismatic. Therefore it is not of faith that this particular Roman Pontiff, for example Innocent XI, is the true Pope and legitimate successor of Peter.

Some respond by denying the antecedent: for one who would deny that Innocent XI is the true Pontiff and legitimate successor of Peter would not only rend the unity of the Church by dividing it from its visible head, but would also deny that he whom the Church has accepted as such a rule should be held as a rule of faith; **he would add to schism a dogma contrary to the faith, namely that the Church can err in matters pertaining to faith.** Thus would be verified what Saint Jerome teaches (on Titus 3) and, after him, Saint Thomas (2.2 q.39 a.1 ad 3): *There is no schism which does not devise for itself some heresy, so that it may seem to have rightly withdrawn from the Church.* This solution is not without probability.

Generally, however, others respond that he who would deny that this particular Roman Pontiff is the true Pope would not be held as a heretic, but only as a schismatic; **because it is not yet established among all Catholics that this is a matter of faith, although in itself it is so, while many judge that it is established only with moral certitude.**

You will object fourthly: If there were any reason why it would be true by divine faith, even immediately, that this man in particular is the true Pope, it would be especially the certainty which is necessary to the Church concerning that truth. But the certainty which is necessary to the Church concerning such a truth does not require that it be immediately of faith. The certainty of the validity of the sacraments in particular is no less necessary to the Church—for example, of this particular Baptism or this particular Eucharist—than the certainty of this particular Pope. But it is not of faith that this particular Baptism is valid or that this particular host is consecrated. Therefore the same must be said concerning this particular Pontiff.

**I respond by denying the minor.** If there were given successively only a single host properly consecrated, which ought to be adored by the universal Church, just as there is given successively a single Pontiff legitimately elected to whom, as head, the Church ought to be united, **then by the authority of the Church it would be established for us as a matter of faith, not only that under every host properly consecrated, but also that under this one in particular, is contained the true body of Christ; just as by the same authority it is established for us, not only in general that every Pontiff properly elected is the true Pontiff, but also that this one existing numerically for the time being is the true Pontiff once the Church has accepted him as legitimately and canonically elected.**

I respond again by denying the parity contained in the major premise. **The reason for the disparity is that this particular Baptism or this particular host is not a rule of faith, whereas this man in particular, whose election to the Supreme Pontificate is validly accepted and declared by the Church, is a rule of faith. Hence there ought to be greater certitude of this proposition, *Innocent XI is the true Pope*, than of that one, *This particular host is truly consecrated*; indeed, there ought to be certitude of faith, otherwise it would be impossible that those things which are defined through such a rule should be certain with the certitude of faith.** And through this the answer to the confirmation is evident, for other Prelates are not, as is the Supreme Pontiff, an infallible rule of our faith.

You may say that this particular General Council, for example the Nicene, is an infallible rule of faith, inasmuch as all things pertaining to faith which are determined in it are immediately matters of faith, and yet the fact that it was a true Council does not pertain, at least immediately, to faith, since this depends upon human histories which cannot cause assent of divine faith but only of human faith. Therefore, similarly, although this particular Pontiff is an infallible rule of our faith, it does not follow that it is immediately a matter of faith that he is the true Pope.

I respond by denying the second part of the antecedent. **In order that the truths defined in the Council of Nicaea may be immediately of faith, it is necessary that the faithful be certain with the certitude of faith concerning their revelation, and consequently also concerning their legitimate definition, since we are certain of the revelation of any truth only because the Church or a general Council legitimately declares and determines that it is revealed; but it is altogether impossible that we should have the certitude of divine faith concerning the legitimate definition of any truth, unless we have the same certitude concerning the existence and authority of the Council by which it was determined. Therefore it is also immediately of faith that the Council of Nicaea was a true Council.** And its truth does not depend upon purely human histories, but upon the successive and continuous tradition of the Church itself, which, although historical, is nevertheless not purely human, because **in such tradition the Church is specially and infallibly directed by the Holy Spirit, just as in other matters pertaining to faith.**

You will object finally: It is not of faith, at least not immediately, that the election of this particular Pope was valid, since it is not of faith that these particular electors are true Cardinals, that they had valid intention of electing, that the juridical form of election—such as the requirement of a determined proportion of votes—was observed. Therefore neither is it of faith that he himself is the true Pope.

I respond, having conceded the antecedent, by denying the consequent. **Although one is not a true Pope unless he is legitimately elected, nevertheless legitimate election is something prerequisite to that definition by which the Church declares this particular man to be the true Pope, and faith does not concern those things which are prerequisite to definition, but only the definition itself. Therefore the proposition *Innocent XI was duly elected Supreme Pontiff* is not immediately of faith, but only this: *Innocent XI is the true Supreme Pontiff*.** Just as, in the definitions of the Supreme Pontiff, **faith is not concerned with those things which are prerequisite to such definitions (such as prior investigation and disputation), but only with the definitions themselves—while it is inferred by theological consequence that the prerequisites were duly fulfilled—so too, in the definition or declaration of Innocent XI as Supreme Pontiff made by the Church, that which is immediately of faith is not some prerequisite such as his legitimate election, but only the definition itself and that which is declared through it, namely that *Innocent XI is the true Pontiff*.**

From this it is correctly inferred by theological discourse that the election of such a Pontiff was valid; and consequently **this proposition, *Innocent XI was duly elected Supreme Pontiff*, is certain with theological certainty, under which no falsehood can lie.**
