### §. I. *Opinions are presented.*

**1.** IN this question, which can be approached in two ways: first, whether this proposition, "*Clement XI is the true successor of Peter, because it is established by the common acceptance of the Church that he was duly elected as Pope*," is a matter of faith; or second, whether it is merely a theological conclusion, because it is deduced from this premise of faith: "*A person duly elected and commonly accepted by the Church as Pope is the successor of Peter*," and from this other proposition acquired by natural reason: "*Clement XI was duly elected as Pope*"—for indeed, all things which are deduced from matters of faith by human reasoning are theological conclusions. In contrast, matters of faith are said to be those which are contained either in Sacred Scripture or in the doctrine of the Church, whence that is to be held as a matter of faith to which faith immediately gives assent by virtue of divine revelation alone, as immediately proposed to us by the Church.

There are various ways of speaking about this. The first holds that it pertains to faith neither primarily nor secondarily that such a specific person is the true Pope; but that this is only certain with moral certainty.

The second holds that the said proposition is a theological conclusion because it is deduced from one premise of faith and from another premise known with moral certainty or through natural experience.

The third [argument], which is reducible to the second, states that it is scandalous and reckless to deny that such a particular man is the Supreme Pontiff.

The fourth [argument] is that it is immediately of faith that this particular man who has been duly elected and peacefully accepted by the Church as Pope is the true successor of Peter and Vicar of Christ. Ferre, in question 11, §7, states that this opinion is now so common that no one would dare assert the opposite.

[...]

**2. I say: it is to be believed immediately as a matter of faith that Clement XI, now reigning in the Church, is the legitimate successor of Peter and the true Vicar of Christ. Thus teach Johannes a Sancto Thoma in [Summa Theologica] 2.2, disputation 8, article 2; Nuño [Nuñez] in volume 2, question 26, article 3, discussion 1; Gravina in book 4, controversy 4, disputation 3; Suarez in disputation 10, section 8; and Ferre in the place cited against Luther, who in his book on the power of the Pope said: "No one without revelation could reasonably assert that such a person is the head of a particular Church, or that the Roman Pontiff is the head of the Roman Church."**

It is proven firstly. The Church, which cannot err in matters of faith, now presents Clement XI to the faithful as the living and infallible rule of faith: therefore, by virtue of this proposition, it is immediately a matter of faith that Clement XI is the legitimate successor of Peter. The antecedent is certain: for the Church expects from Clement XI definitions of faith, desires the rule of morals, seeks the canonization of Saints, requests indulgences, and requires solutions in doubts concerning matters of faith. The consequence is proven: assent given to a proposition dictated by the Church in matters pertaining to faith is elicited immediately from faith, but the assent given by the faithful to this proposition—"Clement XI is the true successor of Peter"—rests upon the proposition of the Church saying that he is such. Therefore this assent, being in a matter pertaining to faith, is elicited immediately from faith.

You may respond that this proposition—"Clement XI is the Supreme Pontiff"—is a matter incapable of definition of faith, because it is contained neither in Sacred Scripture nor in the tradition of the Church, and otherwise the Church cannot define as a matter of faith except what is contained in one or the other source.

**3. On the contrary, from the times of the Apostles it has been held as certain and practiced in the Church that the true successor of Peter is he whom the Church has elected and commonly accepted as such. Therefore, if the Church has elected and commonly accepted Clement XI as the true successor of Peter, then it is already established from the tradition of the Church that Clement XI is the legitimate successor of Peter and the true Vicar of Christ.** This is demonstrated in two ways: First, when the Pope defines something, not only is that which he defines a matter of faith, but moreover it is a matter of faith that here and now he defines it correctly. This comes from the practice of the Church alone, thus understanding what Christ said to Peter, and consequently to all his legitimate successors: "Therefore I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith may not fail," Luke 22, v. 32. Since, therefore, it is established by the same practice of the Church that he is the true successor of Peter whom the Church peacefully receives as such, it follows that it is immediately a matter of faith that this man who has been duly elected and peacefully accepted by the whole Church is the true and legitimate Pope. Second, just as the election of such a person as Pope can suffer defect either on the part of the person elected or on the part of the Electors, so the particular definitions of such a Pontiff can suffer defect, either on the part of the definition, if it does not have the requisites, or on the part of the matter defined, if it is not in the realm of faith; and nevertheless it is to be believed immediately as a matter of faith that such a particular definition is correct and optimal, because the practice of the Church teaches that whenever the Pontiff defines, he defines correctly. Similarly, therefore, it will be immediately a matter of faith to believe that Clement XI is the true and legitimate successor of Peter, because the ancient tradition of the Church teaches that he is the true Pope whom the Church peacefully accepts as such. **For God would never allow someone who had not been canonically elected to be peacefully accepted by the Church as the living rule of faith; or if He permitted such peaceful acceptance, He would supply for whatever defects were committed in his election.**

[...]

However, regarding the certainty of the Pope, the reasoning is different, since the faithful are not only bound to believe in general that definitions emanating from a properly elected and commonly accepted Pope are matters of faith; but they are bound to believe immediately as a matter of faith that definitions proceeding from this particular Pontiff, to whom the Church submits itself as the true Vicar of Christ, are to be held as matters of faith. They cannot show immediate faith to these unless they also immediately believe as a matter of faith that this particular Pope is the true successor of Peter. Indeed, if one believes such a definition because of this Pope who defines it, it is necessary that one believes this defining Pope has the power to define matters of faith, which power he cannot have unless he is the true successor of Peter. Therefore, it is not sufficient for the faithful to believe in general that a man properly elected as Pope and peacefully accepted by the Church is a living rule of faith, true successor of Peter, and Vicar of Christ; but furthermore, one must believe as a matter of faith that this Clement XI, to whom the Church now submits itself as its true visible Head, is properly elected and the true successor of Peter, because Christ granted infallibility in definitions only to Peter and his legitimate successors.

[...]

Before the Church's acceptance, it cannot be established as a matter of faith that this man has been properly elected, because the peaceful acceptance of this elected man as the successor of Peter is equivalently, or virtually, a definition that he is Pope. Thus, through such acceptance, as if through a definition, it is declared that the one who is peacefully accepted by the Church as Pope is the true successor of Peter; and then it is theologically inferred that in his election, whatever was required by law to be observed was indeed observed.

[...]

**12.** The objection is answered by denying the antecedent. To the proof, the major premise is denied, because one who denies that Clement XI, whom the Church believes to be the true successor of Peter, is the true Pope, directly departs from the faith of the Church, and thus is a heretic, and not merely a schismatic. St. Augustine says in book 20 against Faustus, chapter 3: "Schism is holding the same opinions and worshiping with the same rites as others, while delighting solely in the division of the congregation; heresy, however, holds opinions different from those which the Church believes." **Therefore, whoever obstinately denies that Clement XI is the true Pope would hold an opinion different from what the Church believes, and would consequently be a heretic, not merely a schismatic.** And although it has not yet been definitively established that it is immediately a matter of faith that the Pope reigning at a given time is the true Pope, and several Catholic authors hold that this is not immediately a matter of faith, neither objection is valid. The first is not valid because Martin V, in his condemnation of the errors of Wycliffe at the Council of Constance, among the interrogatories to be made to those suspected in faith to determine whether they believe legitimately, includes this question: "Likewise, whether he believes that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time (with his name explicitly stated), is the successor of Peter, having supreme authority in the Church of God?" Nor does the second objection stand, because we maintain our position as more probable, indeed as the safer one, though not so certain that it cannot be denied by anyone. Nevertheless, those who deny it should carefully consider the words of the aforementioned interrogatory, as well as the reasons adduced in its proof, and take counsel for themselves.

[...]

Therefore, when we believe a pontifical definition, we believe two things by faith: first, that which is proposed in such a definition, and this we believe because God has revealed it; second, that such a definition is legitimate, and this we believe by the same faith by which we believe that this defining Pontiff truly has the authority to define. **Thus, although the faith by which we believe that this defining person is the true Pope functions only as a condition with respect to the matter defined, nevertheless, for us to believe that the definition is legitimate, it does not function as a condition, but is the very faith itself. For we believe a definition to be legitimate only because we believe that it comes from a legitimate Pontiff. Nor, in order to believe by faith that this particular Roman Pontiff is the true Pope, must we consider whether he defines something of faith; it is to be believed by faith that he is the true Pope even before he defines anything, because the common acceptance of the whole Church is a declaration, or an equivalent definition, that this particular person elected as Pope is the true successor of Peter. Therefore, whether he defines something or not, as long as he is commonly accepted by the whole Church, it must be held as a matter of faith that he is the legitimate successor of Peter.**
