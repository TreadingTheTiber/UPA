## Question 32

[...]

**[16]** Another question arises about whether one may except against a Pope’s election at any time, even after the Pope has been peacefully received. Some might think that one need not consider whether he has been received or enthroned. Since at the moment the elect consents, if legitimately elected, he immediately has from God full authority over the entire Church, independent of the Church’s confirmation, by which he can command and compel the Church to receive and obey him, it might seem that even if it later appears that he was nullly elected, one could still raise an exception in law and fact. However, it is said first that if a Pope has been peacefully received by the entire Church without opposition, no exception at all can be given against him. Only if he is found to be currently heretical (and incorrigible) can he be accused, not for nullity of election, but to depose him as a heretic. Many authors taught that against a Pope received by the whole Church, no exception of nullity can stand. If God permits a man chosen by the Church to be heretical, it would be a sign of Divine providence or guidance that the defect would not remain hidden until he was universally received.

**[17]** Nevertheless, it is said first that if a Pope was received not merely by the Cardinals, **but by the entire Church, peacefully and without any opposition, absolutely no exception can afterward be raised against him.** It can only be said that if at some point he is discovered to be a current heretic and incorrigible, he might then be deposed. Speaking of heresy, certain authors—Alanus, Vincentius, Innocentius, Nicolaus de Compostella, Ioannes Andreae, Butrius, Cardinalis (possibly a reference to a known Cardinal commentator), Panormitanus, Ancharanus, and Ioannes de Imola in *cap. Licet De elect.*—all referred together by Cardinal Iacobatius (*l.3 de Concil. art.1 s. Sed quid si Papa & seq. pag. mihi 143*) teach this conclusion. And it is borne out by a double reasoning. Because a nullity of the papal election that arises by divine or natural law would, if it existed, always be possible to raise against him. **But I say that such a nullity cannot morally occur if the Pope has been canonically elected in the face of the Church and universally accepted by it. For the Church, which receives the Pope as the infallible rule of faith, shall never err by receiving as Pope someone who is insane, an infant, a woman, or unbaptized. When the Church has exercised the due moral diligence (which it always will, with Christ assisting), it will not err. Because in order for the Church to be certain that it cannot be deceived by the Pope, it must also be certain that he is a true Pope who receives the infallible assistance of the Holy Spirit. For this certainty to stand, there must exist on earth a judge who can infallibly determine that the elected person is a true Pope. But this judge is no one other than the Church itself, to which Christ entrusted the election of the Pontiff. Thus, the Church must also have certain judgment that the election is valid. Whether this judgment be made juridically by a Council or extrajudicially by the Church’s universal and peaceful reception of the Pope, the result is the same. It is not that the consensus and acceptance of the faithful constitutes the election or confirms it—since the election is perfect in itself once performed canonically by the Cardinals—but their acceptance is an infallible effect and sign of a valid election. Consequently, one cannot admit an exception against such an election once accepted, just as no opposition is admitted against a sentence that has passed into a res judicata and whose justice is now certain and manifest.**

[...]

**[19]** Nor does it serve as an objection if one argues from what has been demonstrated above that, since a nullity introduced by positive law is not such in conscience, the one elected remains a true Pope—though deposable if a defect of person or election is established—therefore the Church’s consent is an infallible sign of the validity of the election as it stands in the forum of conscience and before God, though said validity is still removable. **From this it follows that an exception can be raised against the election, so that the election might be annulled in the external forum. For it is said that even before the consent of the universal Church, a papal election made in the face of the Church is in some sense valid; but the Church’s consent is the infallible notification that the election is valid, absolutely speaking. This is because the Church needs certain faith that the one elected is, absolutely, the true Pope and that the acts carried out by him are infallible in those matters wherein the Pope cannot err. To this certain faith, the Church’s judgment is necessary and conducive. For if the papal election were doubtful, the judgment concerning its value could not belong to the Pope-elect himself, since amid that doubt he could not bind the Church.**

**[20]** Therefore, it must pertain to the Church itself, since there is no one else to whom such a judgment could be assigned. By the same reasoning that we say, even though the process preceding the canonization of Saints relies on fallible proceedings—where falsehood can creep in—yet at the very act of canonization, the Holy Spirit’s inspiration leads the Pope infallibly; **so too, although the judgment concerning the making of a papal election depends on fallible principles, the Church’s actual reception of the Pope-elect proceeds from the infallible inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Thus the Church is governed so that it never has accepted, nor ever will accept, one incapable of the papacy by divine law, nor does it receive—nor will it ever receive—anyone but a true Pontiff. In this manner, the Church, in receiving a Pontiff, cannot err. This was upheld by Gravina *[Tom. 3, Lib. 4, Contr. 4, Diff. 3]*, John of St. Thomas *[2.2, a q. a. up to a.7 disp. 2 a.2]*, and other theologians, who hold it as a matter of faith that a Pope canonically elected in the face of the Church and received as such by the Church is to be believed the true Pope and the successor of Blessed Peter, possessing plenitude of power in God’s Church. Further, I add from the same John of St. Thomas that this acceptance by the Church first takes place through the unanimous election by at least two-thirds of the Cardinals, with none dissenting or objecting, and that the public declaration, whereby the election is proclaimed to the people by one Cardinal in the name of all, is as it were a definitive declaration of this legitimate election, which is effectively confirmed and completed when the elected is accepted by the remaining Prelates and the Roman people, and subsequently is accepted by other Prelates outside Rome, with no one among the faithful contradicting.**

**[21]** But when speaking of nullities not arising from the law of nature or divine law, the reasoning for the conclusion differs, since laws invalidating a papal election do not encompass a case as it is taken to be possible here. For in many particular instances, it is not morally possible that the person who is accepted by the Cardinals (who are together in the Conclave) be one who was not elected by them, with none dissenting and with no part of the Church raising an outcry. And if the violence were so great that it continued, the election could not become valid during that violence. In that case, such acceptance would not be free, and thus would not serve as a legitimate confirmation of the election; and once the fear ceased, anyone could lawfully protest against one who had been so violently intruded, and someone would certainly do so. **Therefore, if nullity arises either from a defect of the electors or from a defect in the election itself, it is scarcely morally possible that the election, being defective, would be freely and peacefully received by the Church, with no one objecting, because such a nullity can hardly remain unknown or doubtful. In such a scenario, directed by the Holy Spirit, it would undoubtedly happen that someone would oppose such an election and refuse to receive the elected.**

[...]

**[25]** In the case of heresy, there is difficulty arising from the Constitution 19 of Pope Paul IV, from which it is held that if at any time whatsoever after the Pope has been commonly received by all, it is discovered that he was at some time before his election a heretic or a schismatic, then that election is to be considered null, and the acts done by him as invalid.

**[26]** **But if the sense of that Constitution is that, notwithstanding the Pope’s reception by the entire and universal Church, his election can still be null not only before God but also before the Church if at any subsequent time it appears that the elected person had once been a heretic or schismatic, and hence that both the election and his acts must be considered null, and that it would be lawful to withdraw obedience from him and to avoid him as a heresiarch, even resorting to the secular arm if needed to depose him forcibly—this would mean that what appears to be may not truly be. It would follow that it is never at any time certain that a given person is the legitimate Pope of the Church and a true Pope in God’s Church; nor that acts accomplished by this Pope are legitimate, true, and valid; nor that canonized Saints are truly Saints; nor that what he teaches and decrees as of faith is truly so. For it would never be certain that some Pope was not a heretic or schismatic before his promotion, nor is it sufficient to invoke moral certainty or moral impossibility. Because for something not to be certain enough to be an object of faith, it suffices that by logical or metaphysical possibility it could be otherwise—that the Church could err in receiving the Pope, or that a Pope received by the universal Church might not be a true Pope or not be assisted infallibly by the Holy Spirit. Thus his acts could be revoked and declared null by law, destroying all certainty of religion and faith in the Church of God.**

**[27]** Therefore, one of two statements must be made. **Either, given the aforesaid sense of that Constitution, God will so guide the electors and the Church that they will never elect someone who was heretical or schismatic, or that if such a defect exists, it will be manifested before he is received without opposition or contradiction by the whole Church.** Thus the conclusion stands that against a Pope elected and received by the whole Church this exception of heresy or past schism or nullity of his election cannot be raised. Indeed, such an exception must at once be considered false and repugnant to the infallibility which the Church has and must have concerning the validity of an election it has approved. And although some say that a currently reigning Pope can be accused of present heresy—which I do not believe possible, for I believe God will never permit a heretical Pope, just as none has ever existed until now, as Gravina and Brouius prove—yet even if that were possible, it would not provide any basis for challenging the nullity of his election. Rather, in that case one could only proceed so that such a Pope, otherwise true and legitimate, might be deposed if he were incorrigible. Thus, no valid exception of nullity of election can be raised against a Pope received by the entire Church.
