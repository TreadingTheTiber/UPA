## Tractus I, Disp. II, Art. XI

**209. Let our Conclusion be this: That this particular Pontiff Canonically elected is the true Pope, Head of the Church, and Vicar of Christ, is the material object of divine Faith. Thus commonly [hold] the Scotists and many others, and it is now the common [opinion],** as the recent [authors] Lumbier, Sendin, and Oxea admit, and as our Perez Lopez dogmatically maintains in volume 2, distinction 8, on Faith to Peter, question 5.

**210.** It is proven, firstly, from the Bull of Martin V in the Council of Constance, in which it is decreed that Heretics returning to the Church are bound to believe that the Canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, mentioning his name expressly, is the legitimate successor of Saint Peter; otherwise they are to be punished as Heretics and Followers of the Heresiarch John Hus. But they would not be bound to believe this unless it were already a matter of Faith; therefore [it is of Faith]. The minor [premise] is clear, for we are not so bound to believe anything except what is actually of Faith.

[...]

**212.** It is proven thirdly. It is of divine Faith that the Catholic Church now existing is the true Church; therefore it is also of Faith that the Pope who has been canonically elected, universally accepted and venerated by the Church, is the true Pope. The antecedent is proven, for Christ revealed that His Church would endure until the consummation of the world in these words: *"upon this rock I will build my Church... and behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age"*. Now thus: if it is of Faith that the true Catholic Church founded by Christ perseveres, it will also be of Faith that the Pontiff canonically elected and universally received by the Church is the true Pope and Head of the Church. The consequence is demonstrated: With the same certainty that we know of the existence of a true and perfect body, we know of the existence of the Head of that Body; but by divine Faith we know of the existence of the Body of the true Catholic Church founded by Jesus Christ; Therefore, etc.

**213.** You will respond that this only proves it is a matter of Faith that there exists a Head of the Church, but not that this particular Pontiff, who is called Innocent XII, is the Head of the Church. But against this, I argue: Therefore it is already a matter of Faith that in this true Church there exists a true Head, but no other than this particular Pontiff who is called Innocent XII; therefore [my point stands]. I prove the minor premise: This particular individual, and no other, has been received and venerated by the universal Church as its Head; **but in this matter the universal Church cannot err, and this pertains to divine providence, as I will explain below. Otherwise, the true Church would receive and venerate someone who is not the true Head: Therefore, etc. Moreover, a vague, indeterminate person, unknown to the Church, cannot be the certain and determinate Head of the universal Church; therefore either it is not an object of divine Faith that the universal Church now actually has a visible Head, or this Head must be this particular Pope who has been canonically elected and universally received by the Church.**

[...]

**215.** Subsequently, the conclusion is persuaded by a sufficiently efficacious reason. It is a heresy of the accursed Luther that a Pope Canonically elected and universally received by the Roman Church is not the Vicar of Christ, nor the true successor of Peter; therefore its opposite is of divine Faith. The consequence is proven from opposites. For if it is heresy to say: *Christ is not true man*, then the opposite proposition is of divine Faith: *Christ is true man*. Therefore, etc.

[...]

**222.** Arg. 3. The truth of the Pontificate and the Vicariate of Christ in an elected Pope depends on many contingent factors: therefore, etc. The antecedent is proven thus: It could happen that the elected person is a woman, is not baptized, is a heretic, etc., but all these conditions, or any one of them, renders the election null; therefore, etc. I respond by denying the antecedent, and to its proof, I deny the major premise. For it pertains to God's providence that the electors are not deceived, nor does the Church proceed to the reception and public adoration of one who is not truly Pope, since the Church, according to the Apostle, *Is the pillar and foundation of truth*: and according to Christ's testimony, *The gates of hell shall not prevail against it*, and He promises to be with it *until the consummation of the age*. More on this below, in the disputation on the Formal Object, where we address the Circles alleged against us by Heretics, who assert that we believe the Church because of Scripture, and Scripture because of the Church.

[...]

**237.** Argument 9. It is merely probable that this proposition is a matter of Faith: "Innocent XII is the true Pope." Therefore, there is only a probable revelation concerning it; but with merely probable revelation, an assent of divine Faith cannot stand, according to Innocent XI's condemned proposition, number 21. Therefore, etc. The antecedent is proven thus: For many Catholic Authors hold the contrary opinion; therefore, it is merely probable that this proposition is a matter of Faith. **I respond by distinguishing the antecedent: It is merely probable that Innocent XII is the true Pope before the peaceful acceptance of the Church, let this pass; after such acceptance, I deny it. For after the peaceful acceptance of the Church, as I said above, even the fact that his election was Canonical becomes a matter of Faith, as does the fact that the Elected is baptized, and many other things which before were not matters of Faith; since it pertains to divine providence that the universal Church does not err, and all this is implicitly revealed in that promise of Christ: "And I am with you until the end of the age"; and in this one: "Upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."** Moreover, the said particular proposition is immediately revealed in that universal one: "Everyone Canonically elected as Bishop of Rome is the true Pope," since the truth of a universal proposition is the same truth as that of its particulars. Therefore, given the peaceful acceptance of the universal Church, it is no longer merely probable that such a proposition is a matter of Faith. Nor do the Catholic Authors mentioned in the argument dissent from this; rather, they are to be understood as speaking about a Pope elected before the aforementioned peaceful acceptance of the universal Church, at which point even those conditions that were not previously matters of Faith are elevated to the level of Faith.

**238.** To some Reverend Fathers it seems harsh to assert that, after the peaceful acceptance of the universal Church, it is elevated to the certainty of divine Faith that the elected Pontiff, universally received and venerated, is not a woman, is baptized; that the Minister of Baptism had the intention, etc. Indeed, they shudder at the thought that so many significant matters would be elevated to the level of Faith. However, apart from the fact that this very position is defended by the most grave Theologians (among them Arriaga, Castropalao, Oxea, and from our own, Perez Lopez, cited), they are constrained by reason; for when someone affirms something about a subject, they at least implicitly affirm all those things which on the part of the subject are inevitably connected as presuppositions; but Innocent XII could not be the true Pontiff if he were not baptized, if he were a woman, etc. Therefore, while we believe with divine Faith that Innocent XII is the true Pope, **we profess with the same certainty of Faith that he is not a woman, that he is baptized, etc., without which conditions he could not be the true Pope.**
