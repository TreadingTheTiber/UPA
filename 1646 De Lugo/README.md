## Disputation I, Section XIII, Selection V

**326.** Our more recent Doctors commonly teach the contrary opinion. Suarez in *disputation 5, on Faith, section 8, number 12*, and more extensively in *the said disputation 10, section 5*; Salmeron, Valencia, and Albertinus, from our Society, in their Corollaries, whom the same Suarez cites in *the said section 8, number 12*, and more extensively Hurtado in *disputation 37 throughout*: **which opinion I also consider true, and it seems to be presupposed in the decree of Martin V, which was made in the Council of Constance, where from heretics who seek reconciliation, it is required that among other things whose faith they must profess, they say they believe that the canonically elected Pope, namely N. who is in office at that time, his name being expressly stated, is the successor of Peter and has supreme power in the Church.**

**327.** It can also be briefly proven by reason, omitting other arguments that are customarily presented, from what has been said above, because this singular object seems to be contained in the universal propositions revealed by God. **For from God's revelation, it is established that the Church cannot be deceived in universally believing any error, since it is the *Column and foundation of truth*, 1 Timothy 2, in which universal infallibility of the Church it seems no less contained that the Church cannot err in recognizing the true visible rule of its faith, than in other matters to be believed through faith. For an error concerning the very rule of truth and faith would harm the Church more than errors concerning other particular objects, since it would be an error in the very foundation of faith. Therefore, since the visible rule which the Church follows in its faith and must absolutely follow is its visible head, namely the Supreme Pontiff, whose teaching and definitions it must embrace, the Church cannot be deceived in accepting as Pontiff and rule of faith one who truly would not be Pontiff nor rule of faith, but a pseudo-pope and a private individual.**

[...]

It is confirmed secondly, and explained, because just as we must believe by faith what the Supreme Pontiff, recognized by the universal Church, defines and proposes, so too must we believe without fear that he is the true Pontiff. For either we can prudently have doubts about this, or we cannot: if we can, then we cannot believe with divine faith what he himself defines; for whenever we can prudently doubt the authority of the defining Pontiff, we cannot be prudently moved by his definition to restrain all doubt concerning the defined matter. If, however, we cannot prudently doubt the validity of the Pontificate, then we can believe with divine faith that this is the true Pontiff. For as we saw in the preceding section, whenever we cannot prudently doubt whether this individual is contained in the universal revelation, we can believe with divine faith that God has spoken about him. Since it is a matter of faith that all successors of Peter are true Supreme Pontiffs, and moreover we cannot prudently doubt whether this man has been legitimately elected as the successor of Peter, it follows that we can also believe by faith that he is the true Pontiff, and that Christ spoke of him as well when He promised infallible assistance to the Supreme Pontiffs by His authority. You may see certain responses to these arguments brought forward by some, and the refutations of them, in Hurtado in the place cited.
