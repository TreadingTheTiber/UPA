## Disp. I. De Fide. Quaest. IV. Dub. IV

[...]

As to the second question, whether it is a matter of faith that this particular Pontiff, whom the whole Church acknowledges and receives as legitimately elected, is truly the Pontiff and head of the whole Church: the following points are certain.

I. **That which, in a matter of doubtful faith, is duly defined by public authority by this particular Pontiff, whom the whole Church acknowledges and receives as legitimately elected, and is proposed to the whole Church for belief, must be received by all as certain in faith; no less than if God had specially revealed that he is truly the Pontiff.** Thus from the common teaching Báñez teaches here q. 1. a. 10. dub. 2. ad 2. Gregorius de Valentia q. 1. punct. 7. §. 39. and Lessius l. 2. c. 35. dub. 25. n. 146, who at the same time also correctly adds that **such a one, even if perhaps in actual fact invalidly elected, by reason of colorable title, with common error concurring, has infallible authority in his definitions, God assisting him for the common good of the Church.** The reason is: **because the whole Church in such matters which pertain to faith and religion cannot err or be deceived**; since it is the pillar and foundation of truth 1 Timothy 3, and is taught by God all truth: therefore, since the Church in doubtful questions of faith is bound to acquiesce in the definition of him who by all is rightly and deservedly held to be Pontiff, **it is impossible that what is thus proposed by the same Pontiff be false**; God, namely, by singular assistance infallibly directing him lest he err; **whether meanwhile he is in actual fact the Pontiff or not.**

II. **Not only can he who would deny that he whom the Church has once proposed and accepted as such, with no intervening dissent, is truly the Pontiff and head of the Church be punished as very rash and scandalous, but also as suspect of heresy, indeed as erring against the faith.** So also, with no one dissenting, teaches Báñez in the place cited, who nevertheless adds: unless perhaps someone were to show that he was not baptized, or was not a man; **but this hypothesis is not possible in the case of an accepted Pontiff**, as will be said. The reason is: both because such a person could be presumed to deny universally the authority of the Supreme Pontiff, and because such a proposition by its nature tends toward inciting schism and grave and dangerous disturbance of the Church.

III. Indeed, also in a certain sense, **it is of the faith that this individual Pontiff is truly the Pontiff and head of the Church**; namely, both because in the abstract it is of the faith that the Roman Pontiff rightly promoted is the head of the Church, and because **it is of the faith that even this individual Pontiff is the head of the Church, at least under the condition that he is in fact legitimately elected and promoted**; where at the same time are also presupposed the suitability of the person and the other conditions required for the validity of such an election. [...]

Whether this is absolutely a matter of faith, there are two opinions among the Doctors. The first absolutely denies that it is a matter of faith. Thus Bañez [...] Alfonso de Castro teaches the same in *De hæresibus* book 1, chapter 9, where he says: *Although we are bound to believe that the true Successor of Peter is the supreme Pastor of the whole Church, nevertheless we are not bound by the same faith to believe that Leo or Clement is the true Successor of Peter; since we are not bound by Catholic faith to believe that any one of them was rightly and canonically elected*. [...]

The foundation is this: because it cannot infallibly be established that an election was valid in every respect; since the election could be null both on account of incapacity of the person—if perchance it were a woman, or one not truly baptized—and on account of intervening simony. [...]

**The second opinion asserts that it is a matter of faith.** Thus Gregorius de Valentia [Gregory of Valencia], question 1, point 7, § 39, who nevertheless limits this, provided that such a Pontiff has defined something concerning the faith. The same opinion is taught by Salmeron [Alphonsus Salmeron], tome 13, part 3, on the Epistle to the Romans, page 185, and Michael Vasquez [Miguel Vázquez] in a certain disputation proposed at Valladolid on July 10, in the year 1602, and dedicated to the Pontiff, where he says that **this opinion was defended by our Society in the Salamancan, Complutensian, Ingolstadtian, Roman, and other Academies.**

**This opinion has always seemed to me the more true. The reason is as follows: A theological conclusion deduced from one proposition of faith and another that is at least morally evident is a matter of faith**, according to what was said in question 1, doubt 3. But this conclusion is of such a kind: Therefore, etc. The minor premise can be proved first by this syllogism: Every one canonically promoted to the Apostolic See of Peter is the true and universal Pastor of the Church; this man has been canonically promoted and elected: Therefore, etc. Here the major premise appears to be a matter of faith; the minor premise, however, is at least morally evident from human testimony indeed, but testimony so certain and established that one rightly believes that there can be no falsehood underlying it, inasmuch as it is presupposed that **the legitimate election is established by the irrefragable testimony of the universal Church.** Whence it will also follow as a consequence that **it is likewise certain from faith that this particular Pontiff possesses all the conditions required for the validity of such an election, and therefore that he is not a woman but a man, and truly baptized**; and this whether he has defined anything concerning the faith or not, provided it is established that he has been legitimately elected and promoted. **For even if, speaking absolutely and metaphysically, it could happen that a woman, or even a man not baptized, might be elected Pontiff, yet according to the customary manner of proceeding, this is so incredible that it is morally judged to be impossible.**

But in truth this argumentation, drawn from election alone, does not seem sufficient; because by canonical promotion and election is understood either that which is deemed legitimate by external appearance and in the external forum, or that which simultaneously also includes and presupposes all conditions, however hidden, required for the validity of such an election [...] If the first is meant, that major proposition is not *de fide*; because notwithstanding such a legitimate election and promotion, it could happen that its effect is impeded by a hidden impediment. If the second is meant, then the minor is not even morally evident. [...]

**Therefore the other argument, which is drawn from the acceptance of the Church, is more solid. For it is impossible for the universal Church to err in matters pertaining to the common Religion of the whole Church, since she is the pillar of truth**: but **the judgment by which the Church accepts someone and holds him as Pontiff is a matter pertaining to the Religion of the whole Church**: Therefore **it is impossible for the Church to err in that judgment; and consequently it is *de fide* that he whom the universal Church has accepted as Pontiff is truly Pontiff and head of the Church.** Where both the major and the minor proposition is *de fide*, it follows therefore that the conclusion is also *de fide*.
