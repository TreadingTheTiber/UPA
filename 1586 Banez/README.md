## Quaestio I, Art. X

[...]

In response to the first argument, **it should be noted that because of this the heretic Wycliffe held the opinion that after Urban VI no one should be accepted as Supreme Pontiff, but that one should live according to the manner of the Greeks under their own laws. The Lutherans later followed this error; however, it was condemned in the Council of Constance, Session 8. It must therefore be said that there is no reasonable doubt concerning the election of Martin V. First, because according to the faith, the authority to elect the Supreme Pontiff resides in the Church.** The Pope, indeed, as head of the Church, prescribes the method of conducting the election and determines by whom the election ought to be carried out; and accordingly established that it should be done by the Cardinals alone. But if the pontiff (which God forbid) together with all the Cardinals were to perish by plague or sword, nevertheless it is certain that the authority to elect the pope, or certainly to convoke a council in which the Supreme Pontiff would be elected, would remain with the Bishops and the Roman clergy. And thus it was done when Martin V was elected. For when three men simultaneously conducted themselves as Supreme Pontiffs, namely, John XXIII, Gregory XII, and Benedict XIII, then through the industry and efforts of Emperor Sigismund, the Council of Constance was assembled, where first John XXIII attended with his followers and those obedient to him; then the other two obediences convened, and by the common consensus of the whole Church, the three aforementioned were deposed from the supreme pontificate; and it was decreed that, together with the Cardinals, six men would be designated from each of the nations that participated in the council, who would cast votes in the election of the new pontiff for that occasion only. And thus, as is evident from Session 41, Martin V was elected by the consensus of all, in the year of our Lord 1417, on the feast of Saint Martin. The Church was therefore able, on account of common error of fact, to depose those three who were called pontiffs, even if one of them was the true pontiff. For all of them were bound to cede their right for the common good of the Church; otherwise, if they refused to cede, they could be deposed by the Church, which could also create a new pontiff, as was done. **Furthermore, even if Martin V had been elected by the Cardinals alone and those of dubious or even false standing, and without the convocation of a council, he could nevertheless be called the true pontiff because of the common consensus of the Church and error of fact. For as is held in the law Barbarius (ff. de officio Praetoris), where there is common error of fact, the prelate possesses jurisdiction, and all his acts and deeds are valid both in civil and spiritual matters;** hence even a parish priest who is excommunicated by name, if there is common error of fact, truly absolves. And thus the Cardinals, who elected Martin V, because they held the title of Cardinal and there was common error of fact, had jurisdiction to cast votes in the election of the pontiff: and thus the one elected would be the undoubted Supreme Pontiff. **Thirdly, it is responded that even if we concede that the election of Martin V itself was null, nevertheless, because he was subsequently accepted by the whole Church as universal pastor, he would have been in reality the Supreme Pontiff and consequently his successors as well. Just as the Goths first occupied Spain through tyranny, but then with the consent of the kingdom became true Kings and are called such in the Councils of Toledo, especially in the 5th Council, Canon 3.**
