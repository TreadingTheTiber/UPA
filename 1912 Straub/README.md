## Thesis 25: Dogmatic Facts and Thesis 39: The Roman Catholic Church as the True Church

[...]

**[883]** *Furthermore, the infallible teaching power of the sacred magisterium extends to all those things not divinely revealed, which, if denied, would mean that the deposit of revelation itself made through the apostles could no longer be preserved intact, as is fitting.*

Truths not divinely revealed can be connected with truths revealed by God through the apostles by a special relationship, and this in two ways: either by a nexus of certitude alone, insofar as, if those truths were denied or called into doubt, the revealed truths themselves would be merely uncertain for the faithful, or also by a nexus of truth, insofar as, if those truths were false, the revealed truths would be false.

**[884]** To the first class belong **facts which are called dogmatic**, such as *that the Council of Trent was legitimate, that Pius IX was in fact the successor of St. Peter in the primacy*; **if these facts were to waver, the highest certitude concerning those very truths of faith defined by the authority of that council or of the same pontiff would no longer exist.** [...]

**[892]** **Demonstration.** *The infallible magisterium of the Church certainly obtains that scope which is required for achieving its end or for fulfilling its office;* [...] **the infallible magisterium cannot, as is fitting, satisfy its proper end or the office imposed upon it, unless it extends to all those things which, if neglected, would prevent the sacred deposit of revelation from being efficaciously guarded; of this kind are, beyond the revealed truths themselves, also many things not revealed in themselves, which are joined to revealed truths by a special connection either of certitude or of truth. Therefore, the infallible magisterium of the Church refers not only to truths revealed in themselves, as its primary object, but also to other truths which cohere with revealed truths by a special connection, as its secondary object.**

[...]

**[1451]** **Declaration.** *By applying the marks of the church already established, we now demonstrate that the true church of Christ—and therefore one endowed with all the prerogatives of the church vindicated throughout this treatise—is that which, from its more excellent part or visible head, the Roman Pontiff, and by this same principle and center of its unity is called Roman, and from its diffusion throughout the world is called Catholic; namely, the Roman church is understood in this place not as particular, nor even as principal among other particular churches, but as universal.* **The thesis is a dogma of faith,** that is, a revealed truth sufficiently proposed at least in such a way that **the true church is Roman Catholic in a specificative sense, namely *this* church joined to the *successor* of Peter in the primacy, who is now the *Roman* bishop, and therefore insofar as or as long as the Roman bishop is the *successor* of Peter in the primacy, and accordingly the name of Roman bishop is assumed for the successor of Peter**; but the thesis is not a dogma of faith in such a way that the true church is Roman Catholic in a reduplicative sense, insofar as it adheres with perpetual firmness to the Roman bishop before any other successor of Peter in the primacy; for although according to the opinion certain in itself the Roman Pontiff remains the successor of Peter by divine right immutably revealed (thesis XVI. XVII), this nevertheless does not yet sufficiently stand established among all the faithful or theologians.

**[1452]** **Demonstration.** **That alone is the true Church of Christ in which is found the mark of the Church that is primary and *per se* sufficient for distinguishing it from false Christian assemblies, that is, communion with the successor of Peter (thesis XXXVIII. part IV). But the Roman Catholic Church possesses this mark, since it is called Roman precisely because of its communion with the Roman Pontiff, who is himself the successor of Peter (thesis XV—XVII).**

**[1475]** *Since the church which is called Roman Catholic was at the beginning either the true Church of Christ or was within the true church, it would have ceased to be such either through corruption growing strong within itself—even though essentially the entire true Church of Christ—or through its separation as a part from some church to which the dignity of the entire true church had remained.* But the former case is excluded, since the Church of the Lord cannot be subject to the destruction of corruption in any essential matter (th. XII); indeed, according to that statement of *Irenaeus* (above n. 1388), it is always kept young by the Holy Spirit. [...]

**[1476]** *Hence for the Fathers it is expressly the same thing to be in the true Church and to be in the Roman Catholic Church, that is, united to the Roman Pontiff,* whether they expressly invoke him or antonomastically name him the successor of Peter; to this pertain the pronouncements of *Irenaeus* [...], *Cyprian* [...], *Optatus* [...], *Ambrose* [...], *Epiphanius* [...], *Pelagius* [...], *Jerome* [...], *Boniface I* [...], *Augustine* [...], *Eusebius of Dorylaeum* [...], *Arnobius the Younger* [...], the formula of *Hormisdas* [...], *Pelagius I* [...], *Gregory the Great* [...], *Maximus the Martyr* [...], *Theodore of Studium*.

[...]

**[1479]** *Finally, the arguments brought forward against this position are weak.* For the fact that all the obediences recognized a single head—not of a part of the Church, but of the universal Church—a successor of Saint Peter, a legitimate Roman bishop (namely, in the abstract), this certainly demonstrates that the schism was not mixed with heresy; but it by no means proves that there was no schism, which, though it may have been pure, was nonetheless true and truly separated from the Church. [...] Indeed, **whoever among the baptized denies the principle that one must adhere to the true Roman Pontiff is outside the Church as a heretic**, whether formal or material. Nevertheless, one who professes that principle is not thereby already in the Church; for he can, even though he believes in the necessity of adhering, either not adhere to the true Roman Pontiff or even adhere to a false one, and thus he is outside the Church as a schismatic—formal indeed, if by his own fault he dissents from the true Pontiff; material, if he is held back only by a blameless error of fact. [...] **Therefore, let it stand that the Church was then in the obedience of the legitimate Pontiff alone.**

**[1480]** *Furthermore, whom should we regard as the legitimate pontiff, or rather, since according to the laws of election the pontiffs of individual series—from the beginning of the schism first of two, then of three—are perceived to be of equal standing, which series should we approve?* [...] For indeed, one or the other of the series of those who had been contending for the pontificate since the year 1378 was certainly legitimate; therefore, the pontiff who was living at the time of the Pisan synod was legitimate, either Gregory XII [...] or Benedict XIII (*Peter de Luna*). And this would have to be admitted even if each rival pontiff had appeared doubtful; for **false is the saying invented for deciding this very controversy: *A doubtful pope is no pope*** (see n. 590, note). But the legitimate pontiff, as having power immediately from Christ the Lord (thesis XVIII), cannot be deposed by human authority; however, by divine law he falls from dignity through the public crime of heresy or schism alone [...]. [...] **But with the legitimate pontiff retaining his authority, no new pontiff could have a place. Therefore, setting aside the Pisan series, one must acknowledge as legitimate Roman pontiff either Urban VI alone [...] or Clement VII [...].**

**[1481]** *That Urban VI was legitimate, however, is established by such firm arguments that this must be held as thoroughly proven.* Indeed, the argument that history supplies is brought to bear here [...]. There is added a theological argument, **that the entire Catholic world undoubtedly acknowledged Urban VI as legitimate for several months; in this dogmatic fact the universal Church cannot err** (cf. th. XXV). **The same thing is gathered from the end of the schism as from the beginning: For Martin V was acknowledged by all as certainly a legitimate pontiff along with his successors.** But he was legitimate in this way, if Gregory XII was legitimate and therefore his predecessor Urban VI. [...] The power of electing a pontiff, just as the power of the universal Church, is supernatural, which is given by Christ the Savior, *not* through mere natural law. But Christ gave that power to Peter alone and his successors (cf. n. 589). Hence there is no pontiff except one who is designated by the preceding pontiff either personally or through electors approved by him. [...] This being established, the coherence between the legitimate character of Martin V and Gregory XII in preference to that Benedict XIII is perceived. Indeed, with Benedict never abdicating pertinaciously, Gregory renounced the pontificate, also granting full faculty to the Council of Constance to carry out a new election in whatever manner pleased them; whence Martin could rightly be created by 23 cardinals taken from all obediences and by 30 other prelates and doctors of the nations. [...] Finally Benedict XIII or rather *Peter de Luna* has now been abandoned forever by his own obedience and by Saint *Vincent Ferrer* himself; whence he also contended that the Catholic Church or the ark of Noah was in the castle of Peñiscola, to which he had withdrawn. **But this very outcome shows that *Peter de Luna* was by no means a legitimate pontiff; for neither, given divine providence and promise, can the entire body of the Church be peremptorily separated from its true head, nor can the Catholic Church be reduced to some corner of Spain.**
