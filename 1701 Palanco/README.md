**4.** Nevertheless, I say that although it cannot be vitiated by the aforementioned exceptions, such an election can still be invalid or doubtful: first, if it is not conducted by legitimate Electorsâ€”for instance, if it were carried out by some who are not Cardinals, but intruders without the Church's consent. Second, even if it is conducted by Cardinals, if it is done under fear that would overcome a steadfast man, because then it is declared null *in the Council of Constance, Session 39*. Similarly, if the person is not elected by two-thirds of the Cardinals, as stated *in the Constitution of Julius II* which begins: *Cum tam divina, in the Year 1505*. Or if any of those constituting the two-thirds were not truly Cardinals, as is gathered *from Abbate in c. licet, on Election*. Third, if the elected person is a manifest heretic, as established in the said *Constitution*. Fifth, if the person were not a man, if he were deprived of judgment, or if he suffered from some other exception of natural law that would render him incapable of the Pontificate, for these exceptions render the election null on the part of the elect. Any of these exceptions, if it were certainly present in the election, would make the election certainly null. But if there were doubt based on serious and prudent reasoning whether such an exception were present, it would make the election doubtful. To the contrary argument, I say that such assistance of the Holy Spirit is not entirely certain until it is established that the election has been peacefully consummated and promulgated. It is in this sense that Sixtus V speaks, and from there we could also verify the certainty of that election. For he says that it is most certain that the work of election is completed by the inspiration and instinct of the Holy Spirit, but it is not completed while it is not peacefully consummated and promulgated, with the Church's acceptance. However, it may not be peacefully consummated, but with doubt, and this is when it can be null or doubtful.

[...]

**11.** Therefore, it is certain beyond controversy among Catholics that the proposition in question is a matter of faith, at least under tacit condition, namely, if Innocent has been rightly elected, and consequently it is also absolutely a matter of faith, at least extrinsically, because this imports nothing other than that this universal proposition is a matter of faith: "Everyone rightly elected is the Supreme Pontiff," and it is believed through human faith and moral certainty that Innocent has been rightly elected, without any reason for prudently doubting or suspecting the opposite. **This, however, given the peaceful acceptance that is now presumed, is denied by no Catholic, nor indeed can it be denied.**

[...]

**13.** I THEREFORE SAY 1. It is of divine faith immediately and absolutely that Innocent XII is the true Pope. This is proven first: Because Martin V in the Council of Constance, in the proscription of the errors of Wycliffe, Session 45 and last, commands that this interrogation, among others, be made to those suspected in the faith: *"Whether you believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, with his proper name expressed, is the Successor of Blessed Peter, having Supreme Authority in the Church of God"*: Therefore, those suspected in the faith, in this time when Innocent XII reigns in the Church, should be asked whether they believe *"that Innocent XII is the true Successor of Peter, etc."* For the interrogation must be made with the proper name of the Pontiff expressed, according to the aforementioned Decree. But they should only be questioned whether they believe what is immediately of faith, for what is only mediately of faith is not believed, but is theologically deduced and known from what is believed: Therefore Martin V with the Council presupposes that it is immediately of divine faith in this time that Innocent XII is the true Pontiff.

[...]

**32.** It is explained, and a tacit solution is precluded; for either that election is considered independently from the infallibly revealed or promised assistance of the Holy Spirit, solely based on visible and human motives humanly presented to the Church; or by virtue of some revelation or promise, by which Christ absolutely promised the assistance of the Holy Spirit to that election. If it is the latter, then the validity of that election is not only morally certain, but certain and metaphysically infallible, because an election to which Christ promised the assistance of the Holy Spirit so that it would not err is, by virtue of such a promise, infallibly free from error, and consequently was valid. And indeed it is not only morally infallible, but metaphysically so, because what Christ has absolutely promised metaphysically cannot fail to be as He promised. If the former is claimed, truly all those visible motives, however uniform and fitting they may be, since they concern a matter not evident to the eyes, but rather dependent on something most hidden, namely on the intention of the Minister who baptized the elected person, and on Baptism itself (of which no elected person is an eyewitness), and similarly on the Orders received, can by no means exclude, through themselves independently of divine revelation and promise, a prudent fear of nullity or incapacity of the subject.

[...]

**34.** It is pressed further, because that election, if we prescind from the assistance of the Holy Spirit, cannot have greater certainty of its validity, or at least of the intrinsic capacity of the subject, than other Canonical elections that take place in the Church for inferior Pastors, for setting aside such assistance, the Cardinals are men, fragile, infirm, carrying vessels of clay, exposed to passions and fallibility, just like electors in other Canonical elections. But other elections, because assistance from the Holy Spirit that they may not err is not promised to each of them absolutely and infallibly, are not so certainly valid that the certainty excludes all prudent fear that perhaps some ground for nullity might have intervened: Therefore, if the assistance of the Holy Spirit is not infallibly and absolutely promised to the election of the Pontiff to prevent error, or prescinding from that assistance, it cannot be so certain as to exclude all fear.

[...]

**47.** IF therefore the reasoning of the Conclusion can be established, so that it effectively proves: For whenever a universal proposition is immediately of faith, and the containment of a particular under it is absolutely infallible, then that particular is also immediately and absolutely of faith. But this universal proposition: *Every validly elected person is the true Pope*, is immediately of faith; and it is absolutely infallible that this particular proposition: *Innocent XII is the true Pope*, is contained under the former. Therefore, this particular proposition is also immediately and absolutely of faith. The minor premise, with respect to its second part, in which alone lies the difficulty, is proven: Because it is absolutely, or metaphysically, infallible that Innocent XII was validly, or legitimately elected. But in this consists formally the containment of the aforementioned particular under that universal proposition. Therefore, such containment is absolutely infallible. The major premise is proven: Because it is absolutely infallible that the Electors did not err in that election, at least regarding its validity. Therefore, it is absolutely infallible that the election was legitimate, or valid. I prove the antecedent: It is absolutely infallible that the Electors do not err in an election that is completed and consummated by the instinct and inspiration of the Holy Spirit. But it is absolutely infallible that the election of Innocent XII was completed and consummated by the instinct and inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it is absolutely infallible that that election was legitimate and valid. The minor premise, in which alone lies the difficulty, is proven first from the perpetual tradition of the Church, which has always held that the sacred election, in which the universal Pastor of the Church and the Successor of Divine Peter, the Vicar of Christ the Lord, is designated, is not completed nor peacefully consummated except through the assistance of the Holy Spirit. This tradition is sufficiently confirmed and taught ex Cathedra by Sixtus V in Constitution 50, thus decreeing: *In that Sacred Election, the Cardinals must be considered true interpreters and intermediaries of the divine will, by whose Spirit, just as the entire Body of the Church is sanctified and governed, so most especially this entire work of election, it is most certain, is completed by His inspiration and instinct, and this is well known to all*. But the perpetual tradition of the Church, confirmed by a Pontifical Constitution ex Cathedra, establishes faith and certainty that is absolutely infallible, and not merely moral. Therefore.

**48.** Secondly, because the Cardinals gathered together, peacefully electing and promulgating the election of the Pope, represent the entire Church in relation to that duty of electing and promulgating, or proposing to the Faithful the true Pope as the true universal Pastor and the first visible rule of faith and morals. But it is metaphysically infallible, and not merely morally so, that the Holy Spirit assists the Church, and consequently the Church cannot err in proposing to the Faithful the first visible rule of faith. Therefore, neither can it err in consummating and peacefully promulgating that election. I prove the minor premise: Because the Holy Spirit's assistance to the Church in this duty is certain by virtue of Christ's promise in John 16: "When the Paraclete comes, he will teach you all truth: He will teach you all things and remind you of everything that I have told you." And that the Church cannot err is by virtue of that revelation or Sacred Text in which Paul in 1 Timothy 3 says: "That the Church is the pillar and foundation of truth," see above question 5, from numbers 3-4.\ But what is certain by virtue of divine promise and revelation is not only morally certain but metaphysically infallible by virtue of it. Therefore, that the Church is governed by the Holy Spirit and cannot err in proposing to the Faithful the visible rule of faith is certain not only morally but with metaphysical infallibility, namely by virtue of divine promise and revelation.

**49.** This is confirmed: Because by virtue of the said promise, revelation, and other similar ones, it is metaphysically infallible that the Church cannot err in proposing matters of faith necessary for salvation. But the visible and animate rule of faith is most certainly a matter of faith, and must be believed out of necessity for salvation, as is evident from what was said above in question 4 and question 9, number 4, where Boniface VIII expressly asserts that it is: "Absolutely necessary for salvation." Therefore, by virtue of the said revelation and promise, it is metaphysically infallible that the Church cannot err in proposing to the Faithful the visible animate rule of faith, and consequently, neither in the election of the Supreme Pastor when it is consummated, absolute, and peacefully accepted, or peacefully promulgated.

**50.** This is further confirmed: Because the visible animate rule of faith (which is the Pope) is no less a matter of faith and necessary for salvation than the visible inanimate rule, such as the Canonical Books. But since by virtue of revelation or tradition the Church is infallible in proposing matters of faith, it is also infallible in proposing to the Faithful the inanimate rule of faith, namely in defining which is the true Scripture and which are the true Canonical Books. Therefore, with even stronger reason, the Church will be infallible in proposing to the Faithful the visible animate rule, namely the true Supreme Pontiff, or Pope.

**51.** It is confirmed thirdly: Because if the Church could err in proposing the living rule of faith, or in proposing a null Pope as true, by that very fact it could err in defining matters of faith. But it cannot err in defining matters of faith, and this infallibility exists by virtue of Divine revelation and promise. Therefore, it is equally infallible that the Church cannot err in proposing the visible living rule of faith by presenting a null Pope as true. The major premise is proven: Because once the Church would err by proposing a null Pope as true, that person would not be an infallible rule of faith in defining matters of faith, since only a true Pope, not a false one, is the infallible rule in defining matters of faith. But if the Pope were fallible in defining matters of faith, by that very fact the Church could err in these matters, because the Church does not define matters of faith except through the mouth of the Supreme Pastor. Therefore [the conclusion follows].

**52.** It is confirmed fourthly: For it is definable and determinable according to faith which is the living visible rule of faith to which all Christ's Faithful are bound to conform in faith, just as it is definable according to faith which is the inanimate rule of faith, e.g., which is the true Scripture. Therefore, there must exist in the Church an infallible Authority to define this, and an infallible method of defining it; but for defining this there is no other Authority designated in the Church except the College of Cardinals, nor any other method of defining this except through peaceful election, peacefully promulgated, because the Church does not otherwise propose to the Faithful, nor define this to be the true Pope, or the true living rule of faith, except by designating through election the true Vicar of Christ and Successor of St. Peter, and by peacefully promulgating to the Faithful the one peacefully elected as truly such. Therefore, the Church is infallible in this function. Therefore, a peaceful election, peacefully promulgated, is infallible and cannot err in proposing a null Pope as true. Therefore, it is contradictory that such an election could be null. Therefore, this is not only morally certain but entirely infallible by virtue of divine revelation and promise, by force of which the Church cannot err in proposing and defining matters of faith. From which:

[...]

**63.** It is confirmed, or explained: Because it is immediately of faith that the visible dignity of the Head of the Church conferred upon Peter will persevere in the Church until the day of judgment, for Christ immediately revealed this when He said to Peter: *Upon this Rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it*. Therefore, it is immediately of faith, and immediately revealed, that this dignity always truly perseveres in the Church of God, except during the time of a vacant See or schism, which does not remove the moral continuation and perseverance, as we saw above in question 9, from number 11. Therefore, since today is not a time of schism, nor of a vacant See, it is immediately of faith, and immediately revealed, that the supreme dignity of the visible head perseveres in the Church today. **Therefore, it is immediately of faith that there is today in the Church a true visible head, to whom the Church is visibly subordinated. This evidently is none other than Innocent XII, because now is not a time of schism, in which two visible heads are proposed to the Church, but only one, namely Innocent. Therefore, it is immediately of faith that Innocent is the true visible head of the Church, or the true Pontiff.**

**64.** Perhaps you will say that it is a matter of faith that this dignity perseveres in the legitimate Successors of Divine Peter, but it is not a matter of faith that Innocent is the legitimate Successor of Divine Peter, because it is not a matter of faith that he was legitimately elected. But against this, the argument already made returns: for it is a matter of faith that this visible dignity perseveres today in the legitimate Successor of Divine Peter; therefore, it is a matter of faith that there exists today a legitimate Successor in whom that dignity perseveres. **But there is no one else today who possesses the marks of a legitimate Successor except Innocent XII. Therefore, it is a matter of faith that he is the legitimate Successor of Divine Peter. If, however, being legitimately elected is required for this, then at least mediately it will be a matter of faith that he is legitimately elected. Let me explain: That revelation of Christ, in which it is immediately revealed that the dignity of Divine Peter will persevere in the Church, is not conditional upon a fallible or defectible condition, but is an entirely absolute revelation. This is so first because it reveals the firmness of the Rock upon which the Church is founded in the same sense as the firmness of the Church itself; but the revelation concerning the firm perseverance of the Church is not conditional upon a fallible and defectible condition, but is absolutely unconditionalâ€”otherwise it would not be absolutely a matter of faith today that the Church founded by Christ perseveres. Therefore, the revelation concerning the firm duration of that Rock, which is the Apostolic dignity of Peter, is absolute and not subject to a fallible and defectible condition. Furthermore, Christ would not have sufficiently assured His Church of the constancy and perseverance of that Rock if He had left it dependent upon a fallible and defectible condition. For if the meaning were: "That most solid Rock will firmly persevere if a proper election does not fail, but will fail if a proper election should fail," by leaving that election contingent and fallible, how could the Church be certain of this today? Indeed, it might say: "Perhaps that Rock has failed because perhaps a proper election has failed." Therefore, that revelation must be understood in an absolute sense and believed as absolute. If that is so, then an absolute revelation about the perseverance of the dignity is an absolute revelation about the existence of a subject or Successor in that dignity, because a dignity cannot persevere except in a subject and Successor, as is self-evident. Therefore, that revelation of Christ absolutely reveals that today there exists a true Successor of Peter in whom that dignity perseveres. But this is evidently no one else except Innocent XII. Therefore, by the force of that revelation, it is absolutely revealed and absolutely a matter of faith that he is the legitimate Successor of Divine Peter, and that the dignity of Peter perseveres in him. Therefore, if being properly elected, being validly baptized, validly consecrated, etc., are essentially required for this, all these things will also be matters of faith, at least mediately.**

**65.** Nor can it be said that it is indeed revealed and a matter of faith that this dignity perseveres today in some legitimate Successor of his in a vague sense, but not determinately in this specific individual. For the contrary is true, because it is revealed and a matter of faith in the same way that there is one visible head of the Church as there is one Church, since the unity of the visible Church essentially requires one visible head on earth, as we demonstrated above in question 7.\ But it is not only a matter of faith that there exists one Holy, Catholic, and visible Church in a vague and indeterminate sense, but that it is determinately this specific congregation of men who profess the faith under Innocent XII, as has been shown in question 6.\ Therefore, it is not only revealed and a matter of faith that one visible head of the Church perseveres today in a vague and indeterminate sense, but determinately and individually, namely in Innocent XII. This is explained because the reason why the one Catholic Church is a matter of faith, not only vaguely but determinately and numerically this one, is because otherwise men would not have a certain Church of divine faith for finding the true faith and attaining salvation, and because only this specific Church has the marks and signs of the true Church of God. But only Innocent XII today has the marks and signs of the true visible head of the Church; and furthermore, if the head of the Church were only certain as a matter of faith vaguely and not individually, the Church would not have a certain rule of faith for discerning true faith from false. Therefore. See the reasons expounded above in questions 6 and 7, for they equally prove that it is a matter of faith immediately and absolutely that there is one visible head of the Church in the individual sense, just as there is one specific Church, and they can easily be applied to the present matter; for brevity's sake, we do not expand on them here.

**66.** Finally, it is confirmed because it has been revealed and is a matter of faith that the true Church of Christ is visible on earth, as has been shown above in question 5, from number 57.\ But the visible Church essentially entails, or at least integrally includes, a visible head. Therefore, it is also revealed and a matter of faith that the true head of this Church is visible, for when a perfect visible Body is revealed, its visible head and members are immediately revealed by the same revelations, since they are intrinsic parts of it. But it is entirely evident that today there is no other visible head of this Church, namely the Roman Church, except Innocent XII. Therefore, it is a matter of faith that Innocent XII is the true head of the Church. But this is most formally to be truly the Pope. Therefore, it is a matter of faith that Innocent XII is truly the Pope.

**67.** It is explained, because it is a matter of faith that within this visible Church, the true head or Vicar of Christ is not separated from the visible head and visible Vicar of Christ. Otherwise, it would not be contrary to faith to say that the true Vicar of Christ on earth is not the visible head of the Church, or that the visible head of the Church is not the true Vicar of Christâ€”both of which are heretical assertions, no less than saying that the visible Church of Christ is not the true Church and Spouse of Christ, or that the true Spouse and Church of Christ is not visible. But it is physically and metaphysically evident that there is no other visible head of Christ's Church today except Innocent XII, because it is most evident that the Church today sees no other head and visibly acknowledges no other. Therefore, it is immediately and absolutely a matter of faith that he is the true Vicar of Christ on earth.

[...]

**71.** I set aside the fact that the evident credibility of mysteries with respect to the whole Church, although intrinsically it only establishes moral certainty, nevertheless extrinsically connects metaphysically with the truth of the mysteries, as I will explain in its proper place, because it is metaphysically infallible that God will not permit, in the present providence, that a false mystery or false revelation be made evidently credible to the whole Church. Similarly, therefore, although the election of a Pope peacefully completed and promulgated, of itself and intrinsically only establishes moral certainty, nevertheless it connects extrinsically and metaphysically with the validity of the election and with the truth of the elected Pope, because it is metaphysically infallible, by virtue of Christ's promise and revelation, that He will not permit someone who has not been validly elected or who is not the true Pope to be peacefully elected and proposed to the whole Church as the true Pope. Therefore, moral certainty alone concerning the validity of the election is not sufficient, but rather certainty about the inclusion of the particular case within the universally revealed truth.

[...]

**75.** But if you should say: Innocent XII is a singular [individual], whose existence is known only sensibly and to the senses. Therefore, it will not be a matter of intrinsically absolute faith that he is the true Pope, since the senses can be deceived regarding his reality, such that he might not actually be a man. I respond by denying the antecedent: Because it is a matter of faith that the visible Pontiff, visibly presented to the Church, is in reality the Pontiff, just as the visible Church is in reality the true Church of Christ, and conversely, as we stated above in number 64.\ Hence in this matter, presupposing Christ's revelations, the senses and visible experience cannot be deceived. Concerning other singular [individuals], however, there are no revelations or promises from Christ, and thus other [individuals] are believed with a tacit condition. Yet regarding a singular Pontiff, no condition should be tacitly applied, because it has been revealed that the Head of the Church will be visible, and that the visible Head of the Church is its true Head. See *above*. But you might say: at least with respect to us, it is fallible [knowledge] that he currently lives, for perhaps he has already died. Therefore, faith concerning him cannot be entirely absolute. I respond that this condition, *if he lives*, should always be understood implicitly, nor do we exclude this when we say that faith concerning him is entirely absolute. Rather, we exclude only other conditions that are intrinsically hidden even from those who see him, which, even supposing that he lives, could render his infallible authority less certain.

**76.** I answer better to the principal objection, therefore, by distinguishing the antecedent: It does not follow from this that it is absolutely a matter of faith that Innocent XII is the true Pope, from that universal principle precisely, I concede; From that principle, and from the fact that it is entirely infallible that Innocent XII is included under that principle, that is, that he was validly elected, I deny the antecedent. To prove this, I distinguish the antecedent: It is not immediately a matter of faith that Innocent XII was duly elected, I concede the antecedent entirely; That it is neither mediately nor immediately a matter of faith, I deny the antecedent. For it is only required that it be entirely infallible that he was validly elected; for this it suffices that it be a matter of faith, either immediately or mediately, that is, that it be immediately revealed, or that it be infallibly inferred from revealed truths. In this way it is a matter of faith and infallible that his election was valid, because it is revealed that the Church cannot err in universally proposing matters of faith, and also that she is governed by the Holy Spirit in consummating, completing, and promulgating that election. This either formally means that an election, once peacefully promulgated, cannot be null, or at least this is inferred from it by an entirely infallible consequence. To the second proof, the disparity is evident, because it is not at all infallible that a particular Host is duly or validly consecrated, nor is there an immediate or mediate revelation about this, but at most there is moral certitude that is absolutely fallible, which is not at all sufficient, as has been shown. But that the election of Innocent XII was valid is entirely and absolutely infallible by virtue of Christ's revelation or promise, as has been shown.

**77.** But you may reply: It cannot be a matter of faith, either mediately or immediately, that that election was valid. Therefore, the solution collapses. The antecedent is proven because for that election to be valid, several requirements are necessary which are not matters of faith, either mediately or immediately. But it cannot be a matter of faith, either mediately or immediately, that that election is valid unless all the requirements for its validity are matters of faith. Therefore, etc. The major premise is proven because for that election to be valid, it is required that it be made by two-thirds of the Cardinals, that they be true Cardinals, that it not be conducted through simony, that the elect not be a manifestly known heretic, that he be a man, that he be of sound mind, as we have seen above in number 4.\ But all these things cannot be matters of faith, either mediately or immediately, because they are revealed neither mediately nor immediately. Therefore, etc. I respond that, among these requirements, some are so essentially required that not even the Church can supply for their defect, such as that he be baptized, a man, of sound mind, validly ordained, etc. And such requirements, once a peaceful election is supposedâ€”that is, peacefully completed and promulgatedâ€”are immediately matters of faith and mediately revealed, because they are infallibly inferred from revealed truths, namely from the infallible assistance of the Holy Spirit promised to the Church lest it err in proposing matters of faith, from the perpetual duration of the dignity or Chair of Peter revealed by Christ, and from the visible unity of the Church revealed along with its Pastor, according to that saying: "There shall be one fold and one shepherd." For from these, as already remains demonstrated in the proofs of the conclusion, it is infallibly inferred that the Church cannot err concerning the essential conditions of a valid election, and that the elect, on the supposition that he is elected and peacefully promulgated and presented to the Church, cannot lack those conditions. However, there are other requirements that the Church can supply, namely that the election be by two-thirds of the Cardinals, that all of them be true Cardinals, that none vote through simony or through fear. And concerning these, it is certainly true that they can nullify an election if they are alleged before the election is peacefully completed and promulgated. However, if such grounds for nullity are not alleged beforehand, but with them being unknown or overlooked, the election is completed and peacefully promulgated with no one reasonably objecting, it already remains infallible that either those defects did not occur or the Church has supplied for them, as it can. Nor do the contrary Canons present an obstacle, because if the Canons declare that those defects nullify an election, this must be understood in the manner explained, namely if they are alleged before its peaceful promulgation, but not absolutely. For no Pontiff nor Council could decree that on those grounds, even if not alleged in time, the election would remain null and the Pope null, even after its peaceful promulgation and acceptance. Wherefore, in formal terms, I deny the antecedent. To the proof, I distinguish the major premise: Several requirements are necessary, from among those which the Church cannot supply, which are not matters of faith either mediately or immediately, supposing a peaceful election and its promulgationâ€”I deny the major premise. From among those which the Church can supply, I subdistinguish: Which are not matters of faith mediately or immediately such that they determinately concurredâ€”I let the major premise pass. That it is not a matter of faith in a general way either that those requirements concurred or that the Church supplied for their defectâ€”I deny the major premise. To the proof of which, the answer is clear from what has been said.

[...]

**79.** From this it is evident, to satisfy an unspoken objection, that not only is it piously believed that the Church does not err in the election of the Pope, but it is theologically certain and metaphysically infallible based on the aforementioned revelations and promises, as has been demonstrated. Nor does that storyâ€”which is more a fable than historyâ€”pose an obstacle, concerning a person believed by the Church to be Pontiff, who was afterward discovered to be a woman. For this is utterly false, an old wives' tale narrated by Martin of Poland [Martinus Polonus], a most simple man who was quickly deceived through his mental weakness, from whom some others transcribed itâ€”all of them either deceived or deceiving. On this matter, see Bellarmine, Book 3 on the Roman Pontiff, chapter 24, and Baronius, from the year 853, and others who have written about the Roman Pontiff, who clearly demonstrate the falsity of such a fable. If, however, you should say: "At least one who believes this tale is not a heretic; therefore, it is not a matter of faith that the tale is false; therefore, it is not a matter of faith that a Pope elected and accepted by the Church is the true Pope." I respond that those who might believe this fable out of ignorance and lack of knowledge in matters of faith, or without pertinacity, would not be heretics, just as those who ignorantly believe other things contrary to the faith are not heretics. However, one who pertinaciously believes this fable to be true and contends that at some time the entire Church was in error by accepting a woman as the true Pontiff would then be a heretic.

[...]

**92.** Therefore, the entire difficulty remains between promulgation and acceptance. I maintain, however, that it seems more probable to me that from the moment an election is peacefully promulgated, and the elected person accepts the election, and all this is authentically proposed to the Body of the Church, it begins to be an absolute article of faith that the elected person is the true Popeâ€”even prior to the acceptance by the Body of the Church. I am moved to this position, first, because the remaining Body of the Church is bound to accept that election and that elect who has been thus peacefully elected and promulgated. From the moment he is peacefully elected and promulgated, no one from the remaining Body of the Church has the authority to reject that election as null, nor the one so elected as a false or invalid Pope. This is because all others, apart from the Cardinals and the elected one, are considered as subjects and inferiors, who are bound to ratify whatever the College of Cardinals decides and peacefully carries out in that election. Indeed, the entire universal Church has committed to them full power and faculty concerning that election, and has determined that whatever that College peacefully performs and promulgates should be ratified by the remaining Body of the Church; therefore that College represents the entire Church. Thus, all others are bound to accept it as soon as possible. But acceptance occurs by believing him to be the true Pope. Therefore, they are bound to believe as soon as possible that he is the true Pope. Consequently, even before their acceptance, it is already presupposed as a matter of faith for them that he is the true Pope. Let me explain: the definitions and declarations of the Pope ex Cathedra, to be matters of faith for us, do not depend on our acceptance, nor on the acceptance of the Body of the Church, but once made and promulgated, they are matters of faith for all subjects of the Church, and they oblige all to faith in them. But the peaceful election of the Pope, peacefully completed and promulgated, and accepted by the elected himself, has the force of a sufficiently promulgated definition of the Church. Therefore, even before the acceptance of the subjects, it is already presupposed absolutely as a matter of faith, and obliges all subjects to faith in it. Furthermore: **if before acceptance it were not a matter of faith, and became a matter of faith through the acceptance of the subjects, the subjects themselves would make for themselves an article of faith regarding the existence of the Pope, and would be for themselves an infallible rule of faith, or at least by accepting would constitute for themselves an infallible rule of faith. But this is repugnant to subjects or members of the Church. Therefore [it cannot be so]. Finally, because the infallible authority of the Pope, once peacefully elected and promulgated, over all members of the Church is independent of the subjects, for the elected one receives it solely from Christ, independently of the rest of the Body of the Church. Therefore, even before the acceptance of the subjects, the elected Pope is already presupposed as an infallible rule with respect to them.** But he cannot be understood as an infallible rule with respect to them unless it is understood as a matter of faith, for them, that he is the true Pope. Therefore [my position is proven].

[...]

**95.** You will object fourthly: One who denies a proposition which is immediately of faith is a formal heretic. But one who would deny this proposition: "Innocent XII is the true Pope," would not be a formal heretic. Therefore, that proposition is not immediately of faith. I distinguish the major premise; one who denies such a proposition pertinaciously, after sufficient promulgation, I concede; if one denies it otherwise, from ignorance or insufficient promulgation, I deny the minor premise. And having distinguished the minor premise in the same way, I deny the consequence, because if anyone now knowingly, after the peaceful election of this particular Pope has been sufficiently promulgated, were to deny that he is the true Pope and Vicar of Christ on earth, he would undoubtedly be a formal heretic, although he would not be such if he had denied it out of ignorance or insufficient promulgation.

[...]

**102.** You will object seventhly: A Pope once elected and peacefully promulgated can fall into heresy, at least secretly. But then he would cease to be the true Pope, because he would cease to be the true Head of the Church, and this despite being peacefully elected and accepted. Therefore, it is not absolutely a matter of faith that he is the true Pope. I respond that there are various opinions on this matter. For some hold that the Pope, in the composite sense of the Pontificate, cannot be a heretic, even secretly, and consequently, from the moment he would cease to be Faithful, he would cease to be the Head of the Church and true Pope; but they deny the possibility of heresy entirely hidden from the Church. Others say that, even if secretly heretical, he would still be the true Pope. Others maintain that even if he were manifestly heretical, he would remain Pope until deposed by the Church through a Council. Still others hold that by the very fact of being manifestly heretical, he would be deposed ipso facto. Which of these opinions I judge to be more correct, perhaps I shall say below. Now, setting aside these opinions, I distinguish the major premise: If the minor premise is true, I deny the major; if the minor premise is false, I concede the major and deny the minor. For it is contradictory to persevere in the state of being promulgated and peacefully accepted by the Church once he is actually deposed from that dignity of true Pope and universal Pastor of the Church. Hence, if secret or manifest heresy is posited as incompatible with that dignity, it must be said that, by virtue of Christ's promise, it cannot happen that a peacefully accepted Pope, in the composite sense, could be secretly heretical, and consequently neither manifestly so. If, however, you contend that such a thing is possible, it must be said that he does not thereby lose that dignity, but actually remains Pope until he is deposed by the Church, or at least until his heresy is made manifest to the Church. For although there may be differing opinions about this, one thing must be held as certain beyond doubt and opinion, namely, that the Church cannot err, either in proposing or in accepting as true Pope one who is not truly Pope.

**114.** Or alternatively, the major premise can be distinguished: It is necessary that all are bound directly and from direct motives, I concede the major premise; That all are bound reflexively, from reflexive knowledge, I deny the major premise, and I distinguish the minor premise in the same way. To prove this, I say that those who have probably held the opinion that they are not bound, since this opinion is reflexive, will not be bound by reflexive knowledge; however, this is compatible with the fact that there is presented to them in actual practice the revelation of a certain Pontiff with sufficient direct certainty, so that they are directly bound in actual practice, indeed so that in actual practice they believe it with divine faith, because reflexive knowledge based on probable ignorance often contradicts direct knowledge. And in this way it happens to Authors who deny that it is a matter of faith that this is the true Pope, says John of St. Thomas in the present work, also citing SuÃ¡rez, in these words: "Not all accept that proposition as a matter of faith in a speculative and figurative sense, yet virtually and in actual practice they accept the Pope together with the whole Church as the supreme rule of faith, and they believe him with divine faith. Hence, only out of ignorance do they think they do not believe what in practice and in act they do believe and accept as the infallible rule of faith, and thus they seem to contradict themselves." Thus says John of St. Thomas, and rightly so, for we are often deceived in reflexive knowledge, judging the state of the intellect in direct knowledge to be different from what it actually is. From this, the solution to the following objection is clear.
