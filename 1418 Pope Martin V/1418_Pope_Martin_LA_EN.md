| *Proœmium.* | | *Preface.* |
| Inter cunctas pastoralis curae solicitudines, quibus premimur incessanter, illa potissime fortius nos angit, ut haereticis de finibus christicolarum expulsis, suisque falsis doctrinis et erroribus perversis penitus, quantum nobis ex alto conceditur, extirpatis, orthodoxa et catholica fides integra et illibata permaneat, ac populus christianus in eiusdem fidei sinceritate, quolibet obscurationis semoto velamine, immobilis et inviolatus persistat. | | Among all the concerns of pastoral care by which we are unceasingly burdened, this one particularly distresses us most forcefully: that with heretics driven from the territories of Christians, and their false doctrines and perverse errors thoroughly extirpated—as far as is granted to us from on high—the orthodox and Catholic faith may remain whole and unblemished, and the Christian people may persist immovable and inviolate in the sincerity of the same faith, with every veil of obscurity removed. |
| *Episcoporum negligentia novas haereses a Wicleffo, Io. Huss et Hieronymo de Praga dissemin. deplorat.* | | *He deplores the negligence of bishops in allowing new heresies to be disseminated by Wycliffe, John Huss, and Jerome of Prague.* |
| § 1. Sane dudum, plusquam omnibus retroactis temporibus, in nonnullis regionibus et dominiis, praesertim in regno Bohemiae et marchionatu Moraviae ac locis et districtibus illis vicinis, adversus fidei catholicae dogmata insurrexerunt quidam haeresiarcha, circumcelliones, schismatici et seditiosi, luciferina superbia et rabie lupina evecti, daemoniorum fraudibus illusi, de vanitate in idipsum (licet forent de diversis mundi partibus oriundi) convenientes, et caudas colligatas habentes, damnatae videlicet memoriae Ioannes Wicleff de Anglia, Ioannes Huss de Bohemia et Hieronymus de Praga, qui utinam alios secum ad infidelitatis interitum non traxissent. Nam, ubi huiusmodi pestilentes personae perversa dogmata pertinaciter seminabant, in suae doctrinae pestiferae primordio praelati et alii iudiciariae potestatis regimina exercentes, tamquam canes muti non valentes latrare, nec ulciscentes cum Apostolo in promptu omnem inobedientem, haeresiarchas ipsos pestiferos et dolosos, eorum lupinam rabiem truculentam statim, ut adstricti fuerant, canonice coercere, eosque de domo Domini corporaliter eiicere non curarunt, sed sacrilegam, falsam et perniciosam ipsorum doctrinam per longas moras negligenter convalere permiserunt: populorum multitudo, illorum opinionibus falsis decepta, pro veris accepit quae diu mendaciter et perniciose ac damnabiliter seminaverunt, eisque credendo, a recta fide cecidit turba multa, et errore devio involvitur, proh dolor! paganorum, adeo quod, per diversa illarum eisdemque convicinarum partium climata, oves Christi catholicas haeresiarcha ipsi successive infecerunt, et in stercore mendaciorum fecerunt putrescere. | | § 1. Indeed, a while ago, more than in all previous times, in certain regions and domains, especially in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia and places and districts adjacent to them, there rose up against the dogmas of the Catholic faith certain heresiarchs, vagabonds, schismatics, and seditious persons, carried away by Luciferian pride and wolfish rage, deluded by the frauds of demons, coming together in the same vanity (although they originated from different parts of the world) and having their tails bound together—namely, John Wycliffe of England, Jan Hus of Bohemia, and Jerome of Prague, all of damned memory, who would that they had not drawn others with them to the destruction of infidelity. For when such pestilent persons were persistently sowing perverse dogmas, at the beginning of their pestiferous doctrine, the prelates and others exercising the authority of judicial power, like mute dogs unable to bark, and not avenging with the Apostle every disobedient person, neglected to restrain canonically these pestiferous and deceitful heresiarchs with their savage wolfish rage immediately, as they were obligated to do, and to cast them bodily from the house of the Lord, but through lengthy delays they negligently allowed their sacrilegious, false, and pernicious doctrine to grow strong: the multitude of peoples, deceived by their false opinions, accepted as true what they had long mendaciously, perniciously, and damnably sown, and by believing them, a great crowd fell from the right faith and was involved, alas! in the deviant error of the pagans, to such an extent that, throughout various regions of those parts and neighboring areas, these heresiarchs successively infected the Catholic sheep of Christ, and caused them to putrefy in the filth of lies. |
| *Eositeque concilium Constantiense a fidelium coetu segregavit* | | *And thus the Council of Constance segregated them from the assembly of the faithful* |
| § 2. Quapropter generalis Constantiensis synodus, tantam fidelium et fidei orthodoxae plagam et ruinam videns, exclamare compulsa est cum Augustino: Quid faciet Ecclesiae medicina, salutem omnium materna caritate conquirens, tamquam inter phrreneticos et lethargicos aestuans? Numquid contemnere, numquid desistere vel debet vel potest? Certe non, secundum eumdem, imo utrisque sit necesse est molesta, quae neutris est inimica. Nam et molestus est medicus furenti phrenetico, et pater indisciplinato filio, ille ligando, iste caedendo, sed ambo diligendo. Si autem negligant, et eos perire permittant, inquit Augustinus, ista falsa mansuetudo potius crudelitas est. Proinde synodus praefata, ad omnipotentis Dei gloriam ipsiusque catholicae fidei ac christianae religionis conservationem, augmentum et animarum salutem et praeservationem, eosdem Ioannem Wicleff et Ioannem Huss et Hieronymum, qui, inter caetera, de sacro Eucharistiae sacramento et aliis sacramentis Ecclesiae et articulis fidei aliter quam sancta Romana Ecclesia credit, et tenet et praedicat et docet quamplurima temere et damnabiliter credere ac tenere, praedicare atque docere pertinaciter attentabant, velut haereticos et pertinaces ac obstinatos iam a communione fidelium separatos, de domo Dei corporaliter eiecit, et spiritualiter eiectos declaravit, et alia nonnulla circa praemissa utilia et salubria statuit et decrevit, per quae alii, qui, causantibus haeresiarchis eorumque falsis doctrinis huiusmodi, spiritualiter de domo Dei exierant, per vias canonicas reducerentur ad semitas veritatis. | | § 2. Wherefore the general Council of Constance, beholding such a grievous wound and ruin inflicted upon the faithful and orthodox faith, was compelled to cry out with Augustine: "What shall the medicine of the Church do, seeking with maternal charity the salvation of all, laboring as it were among the frenzied and the lethargic? Should it neglect them, should it cease its efforts, or is it able to do so?" Certainly not, according to the same authority; rather it must necessarily be troublesome to both, though hostile to neither. For the physician is troublesome to the raging madman, and the father to the undisciplined son—the former by restraining, the latter by chastising—but both act out of love. But if they neglect them and permit them to perish, says Augustine, "such false gentleness is rather cruelty." Therefore the aforementioned synod, for the glory of Almighty God and for the preservation and increase of the Catholic faith and Christian religion, and for the salvation and protection of souls, corporally cast out from the house of God John Wycliffe, John Huss, and Jerome [of Prague], who, among other things, pertinaciously attempted to believe, hold, preach, and teach many rash and damnable things concerning the holy sacrament of the Eucharist and other sacraments of the Church and articles of faith, differently from what the holy Roman Church believes, holds, preaches, and teaches. The synod declared them to be heretics, pertinacious and obstinate, already separated from the communion of the faithful and spiritually cast out. And it established and decreed certain other useful and salutary measures concerning the aforementioned matters, by which others who, on account of these heresiarchs and their false doctrines, had spiritually departed from the house of God, might be led back to the paths of truth through canonical ways. |
| *Sed nonnullis eorum rectoribus illorum legentibus libros, haeresesqne tuentibus* | | *But as some of their rectors read their books and defend heresies* |
| § 3. Et quia, sicut dolenter accepimus, non solum in regno Bohemiae et marchionatus dominiis et locis supradictis, verum etiam in quibusdam partibus et provinciis contiguis seu vicinis eisdem, etiam nonnulli ex sectatoribus et sequacibus haerearum ac errorum haereiarcharum praedictorum, timore divino et pudore humano prorsus abiectis, nec de ipsorum, et praesertim Ioannis Huss et Hieronymi, interitu miserabili sumentes conversionis et poenitentiae fructum, sed tamquam in profundum pressi peccatorum, Dominum Deum blasphemare non cessant, ducentes in irritum nomen Eius, quorum mentes pater mendacii sic damnabiliter excaecavit, ut praedictos libros, codices et opuscula, haereses et errores continentes seu continentia, dudum etiam per synodum praefatam damnatos et damnata, ac ignibus concremanda deputata et concremata legunt, student, ac ex eis in sui et multorum simplicium periculum, nedum contra statuta, decreta et ordinata in synodo supradicta, sed etiam contra canonicas sanctiones dogmatizare praesumunt in animarum periculum ac puritatis fidei denigrationem et scandalum plurimorum. | | § 3. And because, as we have received with sorrow, not only in the kingdom of Bohemia and the aforementioned dominions, marquisates, and places, but also in certain contiguous or neighboring regions and provinces, even some of the sectarians and followers of the heresies and errors of the aforementioned heresiarchs, having utterly cast aside divine fear and human shame, and not drawing the fruit of conversion and penance from their miserable death, especially that of John Huss and Jerome, but as though pressed down into the depths of sins, do not cease to blaspheme the Lord God, bringing His name to nothing, whose minds the father of lies has so damnably blinded that they read, study, and from the aforementioned books, codices, and pamphlets—containing heresies and errors long since condemned by the aforementioned synod and assigned to be burned by fire and so burned—presume to dogmatize, to their own peril and that of many simple people, not only against the statutes, decrees, and ordinances established in the aforementioned synod, but also against canonical sanctions, to the danger of souls, the defamation of the purity of faith, and the scandal of many. |
| *Martinus PP. Ecclesiarum mandat praelatis, ut eosdem tamquam haereticos indicatos saeculari tradant Curiae puniendos:* | | *Pope Martin commands the prelates of the Churches to hand over these same persons as declared heretics to the secular Court for punishment:* |
| § 4. Nos igitur, attendentes quod error, cui non resistitur, approbari videtur, ac malis et perniciosis erroribus huiusmodi resistere ac eos de medio Christi fidelium, et praesertim de supradictis Bohemiae et Moraviae dominiis et districtibus ac confinibus et viciniis eorum, ne amplius et latius se extendant, funditus evellere cupientes, discretioni vestrae, sacro approbante concilio Constantiensi, per apostolica scripta committimus et mandamus quatenus vos, archiepiscopi et episcopi ac electi, et quilibet vestrum, per se seu alium vel alios, quos graves et idoneas personas spiritualem iurisdictionem habentes esse volumus, omnes et singulos, cuiuscumque dignitatis, officii, praeeminentiae, status vel conditionis existant, et quibuscumque nominibus censeantur, qui, de praeexcelso, salutifero et supermirabili sacramento Corporis et Sanguinis D. N. Iesu Christi, vel de Baptismate seu peccatorum Confessione, Poenitentiae pro peccatis iniunctione vel reliquis ecclesiasticis sacramentis seu fidei articulis aliter sentire aut docere, quam sacrosancta Romana Ecclesia et universalis docet, praedicat et observat, aut articulos seu libros et doctrinas praefatorum haeresiarchаrum Ioannis Wicleff et Ioannis Huss et Hieronymi, per eamdem Constantiensem synodum, cum suis auctoribus, ut praedicitur, damnatos et damnatas, tenere, credere et dogmatizare, ac vitae finem ipsorum haeresiarchаrum publice vel occulte pertinaciter quomodolibet laudare vel approbare praesumpserint, eorumque receptatores, defensores et fautores quoslibet,etiam contemplatione praedictorum errorum, necnon credentes et adhaerentes eisdem, tamquam haereticos iudicetis, et velut haereticos saeculari curiae relinquatis. | | § 4. We, therefore, considering that an error which is not resisted appears to be approved, and desiring to resist such evil and pernicious errors and to completely uproot them from among the Christian faithful, especially from the aforementioned domains and districts of Bohemia and Moravia and their borders and vicinities, lest they spread further and more widely, with the sacred approval of the Council of Constance, we commit and command to your discretion by apostolic writings that you, archbishops and bishops and those elected [to these offices], and any one of you, by himself or through another or others, whom we wish to be grave and suitable persons having spiritual jurisdiction, should judge as heretics all and each, of whatever dignity, office, preeminence, state or condition they may be, and by whatever names they may be known, who presume to think or teach otherwise than the most holy Roman Church and the universal [Church] teaches, preaches, and observes concerning the most excellent, saving, and most wonderful sacrament of the Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ, or concerning Baptism or Confession of sins, the imposition of Penance for sins, or the remaining ecclesiastical sacraments or articles of faith, or who presume in any way to hold, believe, and dogmatize the articles or books and teachings of the aforementioned heresiarchs John Wycliffe and John Huss and Jerome [of Prague], condemned along with their authors by the same Council of Constance, as stated, or who publicly or secretly, obstinately in any way presume to praise or approve the end of the lives of these same heresiarchs, and any receivers, defenders and supporters of them, even in consideration of the aforementioned errors, as well as those believing in and adhering to them, and you should abandon them as heretics to the secular court. |
| *Receptatores eorum coerceant.* | | *Let them restrain those who harbor them.* |
| § 5. Receptatores quoque, fautores et defensores huiusmodi pestiferarum personarum, quae erroribus ipsis crediderint, nec favore aut contemplatione errorum ipsorum, sed forte carnalis amoris causa vel occasione alia huiusmodi personas pestiferas receptaverint, praeter poenas ab utroque iure talibus inflictas, per iudices competentes, tanta severitate poenarum, in tam enormi scelere, ultionem accipiant, quod cedat caeteris crassantibus in exemplum, ut, quos Dei timor a malo non revocat, saltem coerceat severitas disciplinae. | | § 5. Furthermore, those who receive, favor, and defend such pestiferous persons, who may have believed in these errors—not out of favor for or contemplation of those errors, but perhaps from carnal love or some other such occasion have harbored these pestiferous persons—beyond the penalties inflicted upon such persons by both laws, shall, through competent judges, receive punishment with such severity of penalties for so enormous a crime that it may serve as an example to other offenders, so that those whom the fear of God does not recall from evil, may at least be restrained by the severity of discipline. |
| *Cum obduratis, praviіs monitіonibus, severe utantur;* | | *With the obstinate, after proper admonitions, let them deal severely;* |
| § 6. Cum reliquis vero huiusmodi secta damnabili quomodolibet infectis, qui, post competentem monitionem ac frequentem exhortationem, qua pie erga eos, spe correctionis et emendationis ac ad melioris vitae frugem conversionis, usum est, a praedictis erroribus et secta noluerint resipiscere, et ad gremium unitatemque sanctae matris Ecclesiae ac fidem catholícam, quae sola salvare potest, sine qua nulli verae salutis subsidium contingit, plene recognoscere et confiteri, iustitiae severitas, prout facti poposcerít qualitas, dulcore misericordiae temperetur. | | § 6. However, with others infected in any way by such damnable sect who, after appropriate admonition and frequent exhortation, which has been piously used toward them in hope of correction and amendment and conversion to the fruit of a better life, shall refuse to come to their senses regarding the aforementioned errors and sect, and to fully recognize and confess the bosom and unity of holy mother Church and the Catholic faith, which alone can save, without which no aid of true salvation occurs to anyone, let the severity of justice, as the quality of the deed shall have demanded, be tempered with the sweetness of mercy. |
| *Principsque omnes monens eosdem ut ex-pellant eius et domniant.* | | *And admonishing all princes to expel them and their dominions.* |
| § 7. Et nihilominus omnes christianae et catholicae fidei professores, imperatorem, reges, duces, principes, marchiones, comites, barones, milites, potestates, re-ctores, consules, proconsules, scabinos, communitates et universitates regnorum, provinciarum, civitatum, oppidorum, ca-strorum, villarum, terrarum, aliorumque locorum huiusmodi, necnon caeteros iu-risdictionem temporalem exercentes, iuxta iuris formam et exigentiam, auctoritate apostolica, exhortando moneatis et requi-ratis ut de regnis, provinciis, civitatibus, oppidis, castris, villis, terris et omnibus aliis locis ac dominiis supradictis omnes et singulos haereticos huiusmodi, secun-dum tenorem Lateranensis concilii, quod incipit, *Sicut ait*, ad instar etiam irretito-rum crimine usurarum, quos publice vel manifeste per facti evidentiam cognove-rint esse tales, tamquam oves morbidas gregem Domini inficientes expellant, do-nec et quousque a nobis seu vobis vel aliis iudicibus ecclesiasticis vel inquisi-toribus fidem et communionem Romanae Ecclesiae tenentibus aliud recipiant in mandatis, nec eosdem in suis districtibus praedicare, domicilia tenere, larem fovere, contractus inire, negotiationes et mercan-tias quaslibet exercere, aut humanitatis solatia cum Christi fidelibus habere permittant. | | § 7. And nevertheless, you shall admonish and require, by apostolic authority, according to the form and demands of law, all professors of the Christian and Catholic faith—emperors, kings, dukes, princes, marquises, counts, barons, knights, authorities, governors, consuls, proconsuls, magistrates, communities, and universities of kingdoms, provinces, cities, towns, fortresses, villages, lands, and other such places, as well as others who exercise temporal jurisdiction—that they expel from the kingdoms, provinces, cities, towns, fortresses, villages, lands, and all other aforementioned places and domains, each and every such heretic, according to the tenor of the Lateran Council which begins "Sicut ait," treating them like those ensnared in the crime of usury, whom they know to be such publicly or manifestly by the evidence of their deeds, as diseased sheep infecting the Lord's flock, until and for such time as they receive other instructions from us or from you or from other ecclesiastical judges or inquisitors who hold to the faith and communion of the Roman Church. Nor shall they permit these same persons to preach in their districts, to maintain domiciles, to keep a household, to enter into contracts, to exercise any negotiations and merchandising whatsoever, or to have consolations of humanity with the faithful of Christ. |
| *Haeretticos ec-clesiastica pri-vati vali sepul-tura, eorum ca-dav. bona con-flscentr.* | | *Heretics are deprived of ecclesiastical burial, their bodies and goods are to be confiscated.* |
| § 8. Et si tales haeretici publici ac manifesti, licet nondum per Ecclesiam declarati, in hoc tam gravi crimine de-cesserint, ecclesiastica careant sepultura, nec oblationes fiant aut recipiantur pro eisdem: bona tamen ipsorum a tempore commissi criminis, secundum canonicas sanctiones, confiscata, non occupentur per illos ad quos alias pertinerent, donec per huiusmodi iudices ecclesiasticos super hoc potestatem habentes sententia declaratoria super ipso haeresis crimine fuerit pro-mulgata. | | § 8. And if such public and manifest heretics, although not yet declared as such by the Church, should die in so grave a crime, they shall be deprived of ecclesiastical burial, nor shall offerings be made or received for them. However, their goods, which according to canonical sanctions are confiscated from the time the crime was committed, shall not be seized by those to whom they would otherwise belong, until a declaratory sentence concerning the crime of heresy itself has been promulgated by ecclesiastical judges having authority in this matter. |
| *De suspectis.* | | *Concerning Those Suspected [of Heresy].* |
| § 9. Qui autem de haeresi, per iudi-cem competentem ecclesiasticum, inventi fuerint sola suspicione notati seu suspecti, nisi, iuxta considerationem et exigentiam suspicionis qualitatemque personae, ad arbitrium iudicis huiusmodi, propriam innocentiam congrua devotione monstraverint, in purgatione eis canonice indicta deficientes, et se canonice purgare non valentes, aut pro huiusmodi purgatione facienda, obstinatione damnabili, iurare renuentes, tamquam haeretici condemnentur. Qui vero dictam innocentiam monstrare, ex quadam negligentia seu desidia, et purgationem huiusmodi facere omiserint, anathematis gladio feriantur, et usque ad satisfactionem condignam ab omnibus evitentur; ita quod, si per annum in excommunicatione huiusmodi perstiterint, ex tunc velut haeretici condemnentur. Si quis vero, super aliquo saepedictae pestiferae doctrinae haeresiarcharum praedictorum, vel aliquibus articulis dumtaxat scandalosis, temerariis, seditiosis vel piarum aurium offensivis, culpabilis repertus fuerit, canonice puniatur. Si vero, propter solam infamiam aut suspicionem dictorum articulorum vel alicuius ipsorum, quis repertus fuerit suspectus, et in purgatione canonica propter hoc sibi indicta deficeret, pro convicto habeatur, et tamquam canonice convictus puniatur. | | § 9. Those who, by a competent ecclesiastical judge, are found to be marked or suspected with mere suspicion of heresy, unless they demonstrate their innocence with appropriate devotion according to the consideration and requirement of the suspicion and the quality of the person, at the discretion of such judge, failing in the canonical purgation imposed upon them, and being unable to purge themselves canonically, or refusing to swear for the purpose of making such purgation through damnable obstinacy, shall be condemned as heretics. Those who neglect or through sloth fail to demonstrate said innocence, and omit to make such purgation, shall be struck with the sword of anathema, and avoided by all until suitable satisfaction is made; so that, if they persist in such excommunication for a year, they shall thereafter be condemned as heretics. If anyone, however, is found guilty regarding any aspect of the aforementioned pestiferous doctrine of the aforesaid heresiarchs, or merely regarding certain articles that are scandalous, reckless, seditious, or offensive to pious ears, he shall be punished canonically. If indeed, on account of mere infamy or suspicion of the said articles or any of them, someone is found suspect, and should fail in the canonical purgation imposed on him for this reason, he shall be held as convicted, and shall be punished as canonically convicted. |
| *Innovata Bonifacii VIII in cap. 18 De Haeret. constitutio.* | | *The constitution of Boniface VIII in chapter 18 On Heretics is renewed.* |
| § 10. Et insuper dispositionem felicis recordationis Bonifacii Papae octavi, praedecessoris nostri, quae incipit: *Ut inquisitionis negotium*, renovantes et etiam exequentes, universas potestates et dominos temporales et iudices antedictos, quibuscumque dignitatibus vel officiis seu nominibus censeantur, exhortando requirimus et mandamus eisdem ut, sicut reputari cupiunt et haberi fideles, ac filii Ecclesiae nuncupari, et in Christi nomine gloriari, ita, pro defensione fidei vobis archiepiscopis, episcopis et electis ac inquisitoribus haereticae pravitatis et aliis iudicibus seu personis ecclesiasticis, per vos ad hoc, ut praemittitur, deputandis, fidem et communionem sanctae matris Ecclesiae tenentibus, pareant, et intendant praebeantque auxilium et favorem in haereticorum, necnon credentium, fautorum, receptatorum et defensorum ipsorum investigatione, captione, custodia diligenti cum ab eisdem fuerint requisiti, ut praefatas personas pestiferas, alios secum perdere molientes, in potestatem seu carcerem per vos archiepiscopos, episcopos, electos et inquisitores praedictos, aut deputandos a vobis, vel ad locum de quo vos vel ipsi mandabitis, infra eorumdem dominorum potestatem, rectorum seu iudicum districtum ducant vel duci faciant sine mora, ubi per viros catholicos a vobis archiepiscopis vel episcopis, electis, seu inquisitoribus seu deputandis personis huiusmodi, vel vestrum aliquo deputato sub arcta et diligenti custodia, ne fugiant, ponendo, eos etiam compedibus et manicis ferreis teneant, donec eorum negotium per Ecclesiae iudicium terminetur, et quod de haeresi a iudice ecclesiastico competenti, qui fidem et communionem dictae sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae teneat, condemnentur, praefati domini temporales seu rectores, iudices vel eorum officiales seu nuncii sibi relictos recipiant indilate animadversione debita puniendos. | | § 10. And furthermore, renewing and also executing the disposition of Pope Boniface VIII of happy memory, our predecessor, which begins: *Ut inquisitionis negotium* [That the business of inquisition], we exhort and command all temporal powers and lords and the aforementioned judges, by whatever dignities or offices or names they may be known, that, just as they desire to be considered and held as faithful, and to be called children of the Church, and to glory in the name of Christ, so, for the defense of the faith, they should obey and attend to you archbishops, bishops, and bishops-elect, and inquisitors of heretical depravity, and other ecclesiastical judges or persons who, as stated above, are to be deputized by you for this purpose, who hold the faith and communion of holy mother Church, and they should provide help and favor in the investigation, capture, and diligent custody of heretics, as well as believers, supporters, receivers, and defenders of the same, when they have been required to do so by the same [ecclesiastical authorities], so that they may lead or cause to be led without delay these pestiferous persons, who strive to destroy others with themselves, into the power or prison designated by you archbishops, bishops, bishops-elect, and inquisitors, or those deputized by you, or to a place which you or they shall command, within the jurisdiction of the same lords, rulers, or judges, where they shall be placed under strict and diligent custody by Catholic men deputized by you archbishops or bishops, bishops-elect, or inquisitors, or by persons of this kind, or by any one of you appointed for this purpose, so that they may not escape, also keeping them in shackles and iron manacles, until their case is terminated by the judgment of the Church, and when they have been condemned for heresy by a competent ecclesiastical judge, who holds the faith and communion of the said holy Roman Church, the aforementioned temporal lords or rulers, judges or their officials or representatives shall receive those handed over to them without delay to be punished with due severity. |

| § 11. Verum ne praeiudicium et scandalum praefatae fidei orthodoxae religionis christianae, praetextu ignorantiae, quemquam in hoc circumveniri, aut versutos homines sub frivolae excusationis velamine in hac materia pallare contingat, et ut de convincendis seu cognoscendis haereticis, receptatoribus, defensoribus, fautoribus, credentibus et adhaerentibus, necnon de haeresi suspectis et aliis huiusmodi perversa doctrina quomodolibet maculatis, plenior habeatur in futurum instructio, tam ad regnum Bohemiae et convicinas illi, quam alias quaslibet partes in quibus haec superstitiosa doctrina quomodolibet pullulaverit, articulos infra scriptos sectam dictorum haeresiarcharum concernentes, pro directione dictae fidei decernimus transmittendos et etiam destinandos, super quibus vobis et aliis omnibus archiepiscopis, episcopis et electis ac commissariis et inquisitoribus in virtute sanctae obedientiae praecipimus et mandamus, ut quilibet eorum infra limites et loca suae iurisdictionis, necnon regno et marchionatu et locis eis vicinis praedictis, etiam si loca ipsa extra iurisdictionem eamdem ultra duas dietas consistant, circa extirpationem et correctionem errorum ac haeresium, ac huiusmodi sectae pestiferae, in favorem ipsius fidei orthodoxae, diligenter invigilent, et omnes infamatos seu suspectos de tam pestifera labe sub confessati criminis, excommunicationis, suspensionis, interdicti aut alia formidabili poena canonica vel legali, prout, quando et quemadmodum eis videatur expedire, et facti requireret qualitas, ad singulos huiusmodi articulos per iuramentum corporaliter praestitum, tactis sacrosanctis Evangeliis seu sanctorum reliquiis, imagine Crucifixi, secundum quorumdam locorum observantiam, iuxta infrascripta interrogatoria ad quemlibet articulum convenientia, respondere compellant. Nos enim contra omnes et singulos archiepiscopos, episcopos, et electos, et inquisitores, qui super extirpando haereticae pravitatis fermento, et expurgando suum territorium, districtum seu locum de talibus malis et sceleratis hominibus, negligentes fuerint seu remisse egerint, usque ad privationem seu depositionem pontificalis dignitatis procedere intendimus et procedemus, ac procedi faciemus, aliosque loco illorum substituemus, qui pravitatem haereticam possint et valeant confundere, et ad alias poenas contra tales a iure inflictas et alias graviores, si expediat, infligendas, procedemus, procedique faciemus, iuxta iuris et facti exigentiam, ac huiusmodi culpae et criminis foeditatem. Tenores vero eorundem articulorum seu capitulorum, de quibus supra fit mentio, sequuntur per ordinem in haec verba. | | § 11. But lest anyone be misled in this matter under the pretext of ignorance, to the prejudice and scandal of the aforementioned orthodox faith of the Christian religion, or lest cunning men be allowed to conceal themselves behind the veil of frivolous excuse in this matter, and so that in the future more complete instruction may be available for convicting or identifying heretics, their protectors, defenders, supporters, believers, and adherents, as well as those suspected of heresy and others in any way tainted by such perverse doctrine, we decree that the articles written below, concerning the sect of the said heresiarchs, shall be transmitted and also sent to the Kingdom of Bohemia and its neighboring regions, as well as to any other places where this superstitious doctrine may have sprouted in any manner, for the guidance of the said faith. Regarding these articles, we command and order you and all other archbishops, bishops, bishops-elect, commissaries, and inquisitors, by virtue of holy obedience, that each of them within the boundaries and places of their jurisdiction, as well as in the aforementioned kingdom, marquisate, and neighboring places, even if these places lie outside that jurisdiction beyond two days' journey, should diligently keep watch over the extirpation and correction of errors and heresies, and of this pestiferous sect, in favor of the orthodox faith itself. And they shall compel all those who are defamed or suspected of such pestilential corruption to respond under oath to each of these articles—the oath being physically taken upon the most holy Gospels or the relics of saints, or the image of the Crucifix, according to the observance of certain places—in accordance with the interrogatories written below that are appropriate to each article, under penalty of confessed crime, excommunication, suspension, interdict, or other formidable canonical or legal punishment, as, when, and in the manner that seems expedient to them and as the nature of the case may require. For we intend to proceed and shall proceed, and shall cause proceedings to be instituted, against each and every archbishop, bishop, bishop-elect, and inquisitor who may be negligent or remiss in rooting out the leaven of heretical depravity and in purging their territory, district, or place of such evil and wicked men, even to the point of deprivation or deposition from pontifical dignity, and we shall substitute others in their place who can and may confound heretical depravity. And we shall proceed, and cause proceedings to be instituted, to other penalties inflicted by law against such persons, and to still graver penalties if it be expedient, according to the requirements of law and fact, and the foulness of such fault and crime. The contents of the same articles or chapters, which are mentioned above, follow in order in these words. |

| *Tenor articulorum Ioannis Huss.* | | *The content of the articles of John Huss.* |
| § 13. Tenor articulorum Ioannis Huss. | | § 13. The content of the articles of John Huss. |
| 1. Unica est sancta universalis Ecclesia, quae est praedestinatorum universitas. *et infra sequitur*: Universalis sancta Ecclesia tantum est una, sicut tantum unus est numerus omnium praedestinatorum. | | **1.** There is only one holy universal Church, which is the totality of the predestined. *and what follows below*: The holy universal Church is only one, just as there is only one number of all the predestined. |
| 2. Paulus numquam fuit membrum diaboli, licet fecit quosdam actus actibus Ecclesiae malignantium consimiles. | | **2.** Paul was never a member of the devil, although he performed certain acts similar to the acts of those belonging to the church of malignants. |
| **3.** Praesciti non sunt partes Ecclesiae, cum nulla pars eius finaliter excidet ab ea, eo quod praedestinationis caritas, quae ipsam ligat, non excidet. | | **3.** The foreknown are not parts of the Church, since no part of it will finally fall away from it, because the charity of predestination, which binds it together, will not fall away. |
| **4.** Duae naturae, divinitas et humanitas, sunt unus Christus. | | **4.** The two natures, divinity and humanity, are one Christ. |
| **5.** Praescitus, etsi aliquando est in gratia secundum praesentem iustitiam, tamen nunquam est pars sanctae Ecclesiae: et praedestinatus semper manet membrum Ecclesiae, licet aliquando excidat a gratia adventitia, sed non a gratia praedestinationis. | | **5.** The foreknown person, although he is sometimes in grace according to present justice, nevertheless is never part of the holy Church; and the predestined always remains a member of the Church, although he sometimes falls from adventitious grace, but not from the grace of predestination. |
| 6. Sumendo Ecclesiam pro convocatione praedestinatorum, sive fuerint in gratia, sive non secundum praesentem iustitiam, isto modo Ecclesia est articulus fidei. | | **6.** When taking the Church as the convocation of the predestined, whether they are in grace or not according to present justice, in this way the Church is an article of faith. |
| 7. Petrus non est nec fuit caput Ecclesiae sanctae catholicae. | | **7.** Peter neither is nor was the head of the holy catholic Church. |
| 8. Sacerdotes quilibet criminose viventes, sacerdotii polluunt potestatem: et sic, ut filii infideles, sentiunt infideliter de septem sacramentis Ecclesiae, de clavibus, officiis, censuris, moribus, ceremoniis et sacris rebus Ecclesiae, veneratione reliquiarum, indulgentiis et ordinibus. | | **8.** Any priests living criminally pollute the power of the priesthood; and thus, as unfaithful sons, they think unfaithfully about the seven sacraments of the Church, about the keys, offices, censures, customs, ceremonies and sacred things of the Church, the veneration of relics, indulgences, and orders. |
| 9. Papalis dignitas a Caesare inolevit, Papae praefectio et institutio a Caesaris potentia emanavit. | | **9.** The papal dignity grew from Caesar, and the appointment and institution of the Pope emanated from Caesar's power. |
| 10. Nullus sine revelatione assereret rationabiliter de se vel alio, quod esset caput Ecclesiae particularis, nec Romanus Pontifex est caput Romanae Ecclesiae particularis. | | **10.** No one without revelation could reasonably assert of himself or another that he was the head of a particular Church, nor is the Roman Pontiff the head of the particular Roman Church. |
| 11. Non oportet credere, quod iste quicumque est Romanus Pontifex, sit caput cuiuscumque particularis Ecclesiae sanctae, nisi Deus eum praedestinaverit. | | **11.** It is not necessary to believe that whoever is the Roman Pontiff is the head of any particular holy Church, unless God has predestined him. |
| **12.** Nemo gerit vicem Christi vel Petri, nisi sequatur eum in moribus, cum nulla alia sequela sit pertinentior, nec aliter recipiat a Deo procuratoriam potestatem, quia ad illud officium vicariatus requiritur, et morum conformitas et instituentis autoritas. | | **12.** No one acts as the vicar of Christ or Peter unless he follows him in morals, since no other form of following is more pertinent, nor does he otherwise receive procuratorial power from God, because for that office of vicar both conformity of morals and the authority of the one instituting are required. |
| **13.** Papa non est verus et manifestus successor Apostolorum Principis Petri, si vivit moribus contrariis Petro: et si quaerit avaritiam, tunc est vicarius Iudae Scarioth. Et, pari evidentia, cardinales non sunt veri et manifesti successores collegii aliorum apostolorum Christi, nisi vixerint more apostolorum, servantes mandata et consilia Domini nostri Iesu Christi. | | **13.** The Pope is not a true and manifest successor of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, if he lives contrary to Peter's example: and if he seeks avarice, then he is the vicar of Judas Iscariot. And, with equal evidence, the Cardinals are not true and manifest successors of the college of Christ's other apostles, unless they live according to the apostolic manner, observing the commandments and counsels of Our Lord Jesus Christ. |
| **14.** Doctores ponentes, quod aliquis per censuram ecclesiasticam emendandus, si corrigi noluerit, saeculari iudicio est tradendus, pro certo sequuntur in hoc Pontifices, Scribas et Pharisaeos, qui Christum non volentem eis obedire in omnibus, dicentes: Nobis non licet interficere quemquam, Ipsum saeculari iudicio tradiderunt, et quod tales sint homicidae graviores quam Pilatus. | | **14.** Doctors who maintain that anyone who is to be corrected by ecclesiastical censure, if he refuses to be corrected, should be handed over to secular judgment, certainly follow in this the Pontiffs, Scribes, and Pharisees, who, when Christ would not obey them in all things, saying: "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death," handed Him over to secular judgment, and such persons are more grievous murderers than Pilate. |
| **15.** Obedientia ecclesiastica est obedientia secundum adinventionem sacerdotum Ecclesiae, praeter expressam auctoritatem Scripturae. | | **15.** Ecclesiastical obedience is obedience according to the invention of the priests of the Church, apart from the express authority of Scripture. |
| **16.** Divisio immediata humanorum operum est, quod sunt vel virtuosa, vel vitiosa : quia si homo est vitiosus et agat quidquam, tunc agit [^4] virtuose : quia sicut vitium, quod crimen dicitur seu mortale peccatum, inficit universaliter actus hominis vitiosi, sic virtus vivificat omnes actus hominis virtuosi. | | **16.** The immediate division of human actions is that they are either virtuous or vicious: because if a man is vicious and does anything, then he acts [^4] virtuously: since just as vice, which is called a crime or mortal sin, universally infects all acts of a vicious man, so virtue vivifies all acts of a virtuous man. |
| **17.** Sacerdotes Christi viventes secundum legem eius et habentes Scripturae notitiam et effectum ad aedificandum populum, debent praedicare, non obstante praetensa excommunicatione; *et infra*: Quod si Papa vel aliquis praelatus mandat sacerdoti sic disposito non praedicare, non debet subditus obedire. | | **17.** The priests of Christ who live according to His law and possess knowledge of Scripture and the ability to edify the people ought to preach, notwithstanding any pretended excommunication; *and further*: If the Pope or any prelate commands a priest so disposed not to preach, the subject ought not to obey. |
| **18.** Quilibet praedicantis officium de mandato accipit, qui ad sacerdotium accedit: et illud mandatum debet exequi, praetensa excommunicatione non obstante. | | **18.** Whoever accedes to the priesthood receives the office of preaching by mandate: and he ought to execute that mandate, notwithstanding any pretended excommunication. |
| **19.** Per censuras ecclesiasticas excommunicationis, suspensionis et interdicti, ad sui exaltationem clerus populum laicalem sibi suppeditat, avaritiam multiplicat, malitiam protegit et viam praeparat Antichristo. Signum autem evidens est, quod ab Antichristo tales procedunt censurae, quas vocant in suis processibus fulminationes, quibus clerus principalissime procedit contra illos, qui denudant nequitiam Antichristi, qui clerum pro se maxime usurpabit. | | **19.** Through ecclesiastical censures of excommunication, suspension, and interdict, the clergy subjugates the lay people for its own exaltation, multiplies avarice, protects wickedness, and prepares the way for Antichrist. Moreover, it is an evident sign that such censures proceed from Antichrist, which they call in their proceedings "fulminations," by which the clergy proceeds principally against those who expose the iniquity of Antichrist, who will usurp the clergy especially for himself. |
| **20.** Si Papa est malus et praesertim praescitus, tunc, ut Iudas apostolus, est diabolus, fur et filius perditionis, et non est caput sanctae militantis Ecclesiae, cum nec sit membrum eius. | | **20.** If the Pope is evil and especially if he is foreknown [to damnation], then, like Judas the apostle, he is a devil, a thief, and a son of perdition, and is not the head of the holy militant Church, since he is not even a member of it. |
| **21.** Gratia praedestinationis est vinculum, quo corpus Ecclesiae et quodlibet eius membrum iungitur Christo capiti insolubiliter. | | **21.** The grace of predestination is the bond by which the body of the Church and each of its members is joined indissolubly to Christ the head. |
| **22.** Papa vel praelatus malus et praescitus est aequivoce pastor, et vere fur et latro. | | **22.** A Pope or prelate who is evil and foreknown [to damnation] is equivocally a pastor, and truly a thief and a robber. |
| **23.** Papa non debet dici sanctissimus, etiam secundum officium, quia alias rex deberet etiam dici sanctissimus secundum officium, et tortores et praecones dice-rentur sancti, immo etiam diabolus de-beret dici sanctus, cum sit officiarius Dei. | | **23.** The Pope should not be called "most holy," even according to his office, because otherwise a king should also be called "most holy" according to his office, and torturers and heralds would be called holy, indeed even the devil should be called holy, since he is an official of God. |
| 24. Si Papa vivat Christo contrarie, etiam si ascenderet per rectam et legiti-mam electionem secundum constitutionem humanam vulgatam, tamen aliunde ascen-deret, quam per Christum, dato etiam quod intraret per electionem a Deo prin-cipaliter factam: nam Iudas Scarioth rite et legitime est electus a Deo Christo Iesu ad episcopatum, et tamen ascendit aliunde in ovile ovium. | | **24.** If the Pope lives contrary to Christ, even if he ascended through a proper and legitimate election according to commonly accepted human constitution, nevertheless he would ascend by a way other than through Christ, even if it were granted that he entered through an election primarily made by God: for Judas Iscariot was rightly and legitimately elected by God Christ Jesus to the episcopate, and yet he ascended by another way into the sheepfold. |
| 25. Condemnatio quadraginta quinque articulorum Ioannis Wicleff per doctores facta, est irrationabilis et iniqua et ma-lefacta, et ficta est causa per eos allegata, videlicet ex eo, quod nullus eorum sit catholicus, sed quilibet eorum aut est hae-reticus, aut erroneus, aut scandalosus. | | **25.** The condemnation of the forty-five articles of John Wycliffe made by the doctors is irrational, unjust, and improperly done, and the reason alleged by them is fictitious, namely that none of these articles is Catholic, but each of them is either heretical or erroneous or scandalous. |
| 26. Non eo ipso, quo electores vel maior pars eorum consenserit viva voce secun-dum ritus hominum in personam aliquam, eo ipso illa persona est legitime electa, vel eo ipso est verus et manifestus suc-cessor vel Vicarius Petri Apostoli, vel al-terius apostoli in officio ecclesiastico: un-de sive electores bene, sive male elegerint, operibus electi debemus credere. Nam eo ipso quo quis copiosius operatur meritorie ad profectum Ecclesiae, habet a Deo ad hoc copiosius potestatem. | | **26.** It is not by the mere fact that electors, or a majority of them, have given their consent by voice according to human customs to some person, that this person is thereby legitimately elected, or is thereby the true and manifest successor or Vicar of the Apostle Peter, or of another apostle in ecclesiastical office: thus whether the electors have chosen well or poorly, we must believe the works of the elect. For by the very fact that someone works more abundantly in a meritorious manner for the advancement of the Church, he receives from God more abundant power for this purpose. |
| 27. Non est scintilla apparentiae, quod oporteat esse unum caput in spiritualibus regens Ecclesiam, quod semper cum ipsa Ecclesia militante conversetur et conser-vetur. | | **27.** There is not a spark of evidence that there needs to be one head in spiritual matters governing the Church, which always converses with and is preserved with the Church militant itself. |
| 28. Christus sine talibus monstruosis capitibus per suos veraces discipulos spar-sos per orbem terrarum melius suam Ecclesiam regularet. | | **28.** Christ, without such monstrous heads, would better govern His Church through His truthful disciples scattered throughout the world. |
| 29. Apostoli et fideles sacerdotes stre-nue Domini in necessariis ad salutem regularunt Ecclesiam, antequam Papae officium foret introductum: sic facerent, deficiente per summe possibile Papa usque ad diem iudicii. | | **29.** The Apostles and faithful priests of the Lord vigorously governed the Church in matters necessary for salvation before the office of the Pope was introduced: they would do so again, if through the highest possibility the Papacy should fail until the day of judgment. |
| **30.** Nullus est dominus civilis, nullus est praelatus, nullus est episcopus dum est in peccato mortali. | | **30.** No one is a civil lord, no one is a prelate, no one is a bishop while he is in mortal sin. |

And those whom through such inquiry you shall find defamed, or through their confession, or through the evidence of fact, or otherwise tainted with the stain of such heresy and error, by the aforesaid authority, even through excommunication, suspension, and interdict, as well as through deprivation of dignities, benefices, and offices and other ecclesiastical benefices and fiefs, which they obtain from any Churches, monasteries, and other ecclesiastical places, and also through secular goods and dignities and degrees of sciences of whatever faculties, and through other penalties, sentences, and ecclesiastical censures and ways and means, which you shall see to be expedient or opportune for this purpose, even through the capture and incarceration of persons and other corporal punishments, by which heretics are punished or are ordered or accustomed to be punished according to canonical sanctions. Similarly, you shall correct and punish the clerics themselves and ecclesiastical persons, even to the point of degradation, if their fault and pertinacity or rebellion should demand or require it, and you shall cause them to be diligently corrected and punished. And also against them and their goods, and those of the laity, according to canonical sanctions and legal edicts issued against heretics and their followers, to which we decree that the same sectarians or followers are subject, you shall rise up vigorously according to the manner and form described above. And those who shall be defamed concerning the aforesaid heresies or articles or any of the aforementioned, shall be bound to purge themselves at your discretion. But others who shall be convicted through witnesses or their own confession or other legitimate proofs concerning the aforesaid heresies or articles or any of the aforementioned, shall be compelled to solemnly and publicly revoke and abjure the same articles and errors, and to undergo proportionate penance, even to the point of imprisonment (if the offense shall require it). And also they shall be bound to provide sufficient and suitable caution that they will not foster such errors and heresies of whatever kind or species they may be considered, by word, sign, or deed in the future, nor induce others to believe them by word, deed, publicly or secretly, directly or indirectly, or by any other means whatsoever. But if perchance they should refuse to solemnly and publicly revoke and abjure the same articles, and to undergo proportionate penance, even to perpetual or temporary imprisonment according to the judgment of your discretion without delay, and to provide sufficient caution that they will not hold nor foster these errors and heresies in the future, nor induce others to believe them by word or deed, publicly or secretly, directly or indirectly, or by any other pretense or color, or should refuse to do any of the aforementioned, then against them according to the quality of their errors and offenses, even (if it be expedient) as against heretics or those tainted with the heretical stain, by our authority, according to canonical and legal sanctions, summarily and simply and plainly without clamor and form of judgment and also ex officio, any appeal or appeals whatsoever notwithstanding, you shall proceed, and you shall punish them according to the same canonical traditions, even, if it be necessary, relinquishing them to the secular court, restraining opponents by ecclesiastical censure, appeal being set aside, invoking for this purpose (if it be necessary) the aid of the same secular arm. |

Notwithstanding the constitution of Pope Boniface VIII of happy memory, our predecessor, which cautions that no one should be summoned to judgment outside his city and diocese, except in certain exceptional cases, and in those cases not beyond one day's journey from the boundary of his diocese, or that judges appointed by the Apostolic See should not presume to proceed against anyone outside the city and diocese in which they were appointed, or to commit their authority to another or others, or to draw any persons beyond one day's journey from the boundary of their dioceses, and the constitution concerning the two days' journey in the General Council, as well as any other constitutions of the Roman Pontiffs, whether concerning delegated judges, or persons not to be summoned to judgment beyond a certain number, or other edicts, which might in any way impede your jurisdiction or power, or its free exercise in this matter, or if any persons collectively or individually have been granted an indult from the same See that they cannot be placed under interdict, suspended, or excommunicated, or summoned to judgment beyond or outside certain places through apostolic letters that do not make full and express mention, word for word, of such indult and of their persons, places, orders, and proper names, and any other general or special indulgence of the said See, of whatever tenor it may be, by which the exercise of your jurisdiction in this matter might be hindered in any way because it is not expressed or not entirely inserted in the present letters, and of which and of whose entire tenor word for word special mention must be made in our letters. |
