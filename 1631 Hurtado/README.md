## DISPUTATION XXXVII.

*Whether it is a matter of faith that this specific man who is the Roman Bishop is the Pope?*

**1.** Those who are legitimately created Bishops of Rome succeed PETER. I now inquire whether the one who currently exists as the Bishop of Rome is so certainly the Roman Bishop and the legitimate successor of Peter in the universal governance, that it is in no way permissible to doubt that he is the Pope, any more than we can doubt any mystery of faith. This question applies to each of the Roman Pontiffs from Linus to Urban VIII: whether it is sanctioned by faith that Urban VIII is the Pope, just as Peter was?

### SECTION I. Two Admonitions.

**2.** FIRST, it must be noted that the legitimate successor of Peter cannot err in questions of faith when he resolves them not by private authority, but by Pontifical authority. This doctrine is to be held according to faith, which Father Valencia excellently proves in volume 3, disputation 1, question 1, seventh point, question 6, paragraph 4, and Cardinal Bellarmine in book 2 on the Roman Pontiff, from chapter 12, but especially in book 4, chapters 2 and 3. Indeed, this doctrine is easily deduced from what has been stated above; because the power of defining questions of faith, confirming the brothers in sound doctrine, and feeding the sheep was conferred by Christ upon Peter; but the Roman Pontiff succeeds Peter in this power: therefore [he cannot err]. If heretics would admit the minor proposition of this syllogism, there would be no new contest with them concerning the consequence, or the consequent of the same syllogism: for they themselves admit that the Catholic Church cannot err in these questions. However, the Innovators resort to their own personal spirit, by which individuals judge whether the Catholic Church designates to them the faithful successors of Peter. Wherefore, since the power of Peter and his successors has been sufficiently discussed, I refrain from a lengthy proof of the conclusion, as it must be sought from there.

[...]

**4.** In another way, the Pontiff is considered when he has already been legitimately elected and acknowledged, such that the whole Church recognizes him—as now our Lord Urban VIII, without any trace of controversy, holds the helm of the Christian Commonwealth and the key of Peter. The question is, therefore, whether it is to be believed with divine faith that Urban VIII, Clement VIII, and other peacefully accepted Pontiffs are the legitimate successors of Peter?

## SECTION II The Affirmative Position

**5.** I SAY that we must believe with divine faith that all and each of these Pontiffs, whom I discussed in §.4, are legitimate successors of Peter. This conclusion will not be found explicitly stated by ancient authors, perhaps because they never doubted it, taking it for granted; however, it is vigorously defended by many Doctors of our Society, especially by Father Suarez in disputation 10, section 8, number 12, where he cites and follows our authors; and in disputation 10, section 5. This opinion was greatly strengthened by Pope Clement VIII, who imprisoned certain Doctors for maintaining the opposite view, and ordered them to Rome to give an account of that opinion, which the Holy See deemed worthy of punishment.

### SUBSECTION I First argument

**6.** IT IS PROVEN first, because unless we believe with divine faith that such Pontiffs are legitimate successors of Peter, there is nothing that we can believe with divine faith, and consequently the entire Christian religion [would collapse]. The absurdity of this consequence is self-evident. The major premise is proven: because we cannot believe with divine faith that a revelation was made to the Pontiff formally as Pontiff, without in the same act of assent believing that he is truly the Pontiff; but unless we believe with divine Catholic faith the revelations made to Pontiffs as formally Pontiffs, we cannot believe with Catholic faith the mysteries of faith. Therefore, unless we believe with the same faith that such Pontiffs are legitimate successors of Peter, we cannot believe with divine faith the mysteries of faith.

[...]

The minor premise is proven because all divine Scripture which has been confirmed by the authority of the Pontiffs is admitted in the Church as Canonical; whereas that which has not yet been proposed by the Supreme Pontiffs as Canonical is not held as such in the Church, as with the books of Judith and the fourth [Book of Esdras]. Indeed, all tradition is derived from the Apostles and has been admitted by the whole Church together with the Supreme Pontiff; and the definitions of the Church require confirmation from the Supreme Pontiff. Therefore, we cannot believe any mystery of faith by Catholic faith without by the same faith believing in the revelation made to the Pontiff.

[...]

**7.** This argument is confirmed because, for example, we recognize by divine faith that in the Eucharist only the accidents remain while the substance ceases to exist because of the definition of the Council of Trent confirmed by Pius IV. Likewise, we believe that absolution given in absence is invalid because of the definition of Clement VIII. Similarly, we believe that sacred images should be venerated because of the definition of the Second Council of Nicaea confirmed by Adrian. But unless we believe with divine faith that Pius IV, Clement VIII, and Adrian were legitimate Pontiffs, we cannot believe these mysteries of faith. The minor premise is proven because to believe is to accept what is proposed through the infallible authority of the Supreme Pontiff, to whom God revealed these things, on account of the infallible promise of assisting him, lest he err. Therefore, we are persuaded that this infallible pronouncement of the Pontiff arises from the Holy Spirit assisting the Pontiff, because he is the Pontiff.

[...]

**9.** Observe that the same difficulty exists regarding this article of faith as regarding Councils: because Councils, in the more probable opinion, do not have the power of defining [dogma] without the instruction or consent of the Roman Pontiff. Therefore, for conciliar decrees to have force, so that they may be believed with Catholic faith, it is necessary that we believe they are confirmed by the true Pontiff. Consequently, unless we believe this man to be the true Pontiff, we do not believe this Council to have infallible authority. I prove this consequence from what has just been said.

And even if we grant that Councils cannot err unless they do something against the consent or instruction of the Pontiff, still it is necessary to believe by divine faith that this Council is legitimate; otherwise, for the same reason one doubts its legitimacy, we can also doubt its infallibility. And there is almost the same difficulty in believing with Catholic faith that this Council is legitimate as there is regarding this Pontiff.

Likewise, there is the same difficulty regarding the whole Church: which, although correspondingly it cannot err in infallibility due to the legitimacy of the Pontiff, still we can doubt in which persons this Catholic Church resides. For let us suppose it to be in the Roman Episcopate; still we do not know from which particular faithful it is composed. For we do not know whether they are baptized, or whether they are heretics in spirit. In Councils of the Church it is necessary to believe with Catholic faith their legitimacy and Catholic spirit; similarly with the Roman Pontiff, lest we waver in faith, his legitimate succession from Peter must be believed with Catholic faith.

Indeed, we believe with Catholic faith that the same Peter, who was Bishop of Rome, was the one to whom Christ gave the keys of the Church; otherwise nothing would be certain. Therefore, for no other reason must we believe that Paul V, Clement VIII, Pius IV, Adrian II, Urban VIII, and others are legitimate successors of Peter.

The authors of the opposing brotherhood did not consider that the authority of individual Councils and of the whole Church is called into question by them—concerning whose internal faith and baptism there is the same obscurity as there is concerning Urban VIII. For me, however, it is sufficient that my position has the same reasoning as other mysteries of faith depending on objects and conditions that are obscure.

[...]

### SECTION III. The Opposing Opinion.

[...]

**43.** I posit thirdly, that it pertains to God's special providence with His Church, not to permit that the entire Church should conspire in some error from which the gates of hell might prevail against it: because He who promised that those gates would not prevail against the Church also promised to avert whatever might be an occasion for the infernal gates to prevail. Now, one of the principal occasions for the victory of these gates over the Church would be to lack a true and legitimate Pontiff, and to have a Pseudo-Pontiff peacefully substituted in his place: because Christ willed that the sheep be pastured by Peter and his successors, just as He governs the members through the head. Hence, if the whole Church were to peacefully admit some Pseudo-Pontiff, it would be exposed to the gravest dangers in faith and morals, because it would be exposed to the peril of accepting false doctrine as oracles, and a disgraceful administration, since that Pontiff would act by his own power, and not God's. Therefore, the human authority of the whole Church could not be morally deceived in accepting an obscure revelation of God; likewise, neither in accepting a Pontiff. From this acceptance, we recognize both that he is the Pontiff and that he possesses all the intrinsic conditions for that office, just as we deduce that something is a revelation, with all its conditions, when it is proposed by the whole Church.

**44.** You will say that the Church cannot err in belief: I acknowledge this, because it cannot err in peacefully accepting an illegitimate universal Pastor. For having a legitimate Pastor, it receives the nourishment of truth and the influence of the Holy Spirit through Peter, upon whom it is founded. But if it could err in the peaceful recognition of a Pastor, it could also err in belief. Therefore, from one impossibility follows another, and conversely, from the infallibility of the Pastor follows the infallibility of doctrine and faith. Thus, the legitimate election of a Pastor and the peaceful consent of the Church to it are certain signs of a legitimate Pastor—such that either there is no dissension among Catholics, or if there is, it exists among those who contradict without any probable foundation; or if dissension exists, they can deservedly be punished according to the law of probability. However, when there is a probable foundation for doubting the legitimacy of a Pontiff, even if he might be legitimate in reality, nevertheless neither his legitimacy nor consequently his definitions are believed with Catholic faith. This is because whenever there is a probable foundation, we can prudently doubt; and as long as we can thus doubt, we cannot believe with Catholic faith. Therefore, at such times it is incumbent upon the Church not to rest until it clearly establishes the legitimate election and acceptance of the Pontiff. And if this cannot be obtained otherwise except by deposing the Pontiff or Pontiffs, it can accomplish this—as happened in the Council of Constance, which began in the year one thousand four hundred and fourteen, where John XXIII, Benedict XIII, and Gregory XII were deposed from the Supreme Pontificate, and Martin V was created. For as long as the legitimacy of a Pontiff is not established without probable controversy, the Church can depose him, as Father Suarez teaches in book three, chapter 18, number eight—although it lacks this right with respect to legitimate Pontiffs who have been accepted without probable controversy.

[...]

**46.** You will say that we seem to see and evidently recognize with physical evidence, perceptible to the senses, the legitimate election and peaceful acceptance regarding these external matters; but not regarding internal matters. For we do not know whether he is baptized, and whether he is a Priest. Therefore, there is no certain evidence about the complete legitimacy of the election. This is confirmed by the example of a Priest consecrating the host: because we see all things that are externally required for legitimate consecration, namely that he has received orders and pronounces the words of consecration; nevertheless, we are not certain by Catholic faith about the consecration of this host, because we are not certain about his Priesthood and intention to consecrate. I respond from paragraph forty-three that it pertains to God's special providence over the Church not to permit the election and peaceful acceptance of one who cannot legitimately be Pontiff. Therefore, from the evident recognition of a legitimate election and peaceful acceptance, it is deduced that this specific man requires nothing else for the Pontificate, and that God has entrusted to him the Pontifical Office of Saint Peter. And so, from this self-evident application, we deduce an act of faith by which we believe that the power of Peter himself has been conferred on that successor of St. Peter—just as from the evident knowledge of Peter, we infer his conception in sin. The arguments concerning a private Priest are not compelling, because God has not promised that special providence in these private cases, as they are of lesser importance and can occur without prejudice to the faith; but the election of a Pseudo-Pontiff is quite different.
