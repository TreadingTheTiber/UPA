**Second Inquiry** It is asked secondly, whether any exception can be raised against someone who has not only been received by the Cardinals but by the whole Church peacefully and without opposition. I respond in the negative with Passerinus (no. 17), citing several Doctors of Canon Law, Innocent the Archbishop of Compostela, Jacobatius, and others in his favor. The reason is very clear: **A Pope elected by the Cardinals and peacefully accepted by the whole Church cannot fail to be the true Pope. This can be proven as follows: The Church, after applying moral diligence to the papal election, receives the Pope by a special instinct of the Holy Spirit as the infallible rule of her faith, in whom she cannot err since she is the pillar of truth, against which the gates of hell will not prevail. Therefore, a Pope so received cannot fail to be a true Pope, and consequently no exception can be brought against one who has been so elected and received.**

Furthermore, the Church must be certain that she cannot be deceived by the Pope in matters of faith and must also be certain that the Pope is legitimate and has the infallible assistance of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, there must be on earth a judge who can infallibly determine that the one elected as Pope is truly and legitimately the Pope. **But this judge can only be the Church, to whom Christ entrusted the election of the Pontiff, and consequently He also entrusted to her a certain and infallible judgment regarding the legitimacy of the papal election, whether this is done judicially through a Council or extra-judicially by the common and peaceful acceptance of the Pope. Thus, the Church cannot err in peacefully receiving a Pope elected by the Cardinals, and no exception can be raised against a legitimately elected and accepted Pope.**

It must be noted, to remove all ambiguity, that no exception can be brought against the election of a Pope peacefully received by the Church not because the consensus or acceptance of the Church is itself an election or by its force can elect one who was not elected, for the faculty of election belongs only to the Cardinals; nor because the consent or acceptance of the faithful acts as a confirmation of the election, for a papal election does not require confirmation; nor because the value of the election depends on the consent and acceptance of the people, since a pope canonically elected by the Cardinals is already a true and legitimate Pope by virtue of that election alone, prior to the acceptance by the Church.

**Rather, the faithful consensus and the total acceptance by the Church is an infallible manifestation that the election was valid; it infallibly proves its value a posteriori.** Hence, given the infallibility of this acceptance, no exception can be raised against it. Nor does it matter that, despite the infallibility of the Church’s judgment in the peaceful reception of the Pope, one might think there is still room for an exception against a Pope elected and received by the Church, not indeed in the forum of conscience and before God, but only in the external forum, so that the election might be invalidated there.

I say this does not stand, because neither in the internal nor in the external forum, once the election and peaceful reception of the Pope by the Church is established, can any exception be given. There should be no doubt whatsoever about the truth of a papal election, because the Church needs certain faith, without any fear that the elected person is not simply the true Pope, and that his acts are infallible. This could not be verified if there were the slightest room for exception. I admit that before the election and peaceful reception of the Pope it is possible to raise an exception both in law and in fact against him; but because the papal election is carried out by the special guidance of the Holy Spirit, and because the Church cannot err in accepting the living rule of faith (which the Pope is), once a legitimate papal election and acceptance has occurred, no exception can be raised—neither in the internal nor the external forum.

John of St. Thomas (Secunda Secundae, q. 7, disp. 2, art. a) excellently explains that this acceptance of the Church takes place first by the concordant election of at least two-thirds of the Cardinals, with none of them raising exception or opposition; secondly, by the publication of the election to the people by one Cardinal on behalf of all, which is, as it were, a definitive declaration of the legitimacy of that election; and thirdly, by the acceptance of other prelates and the Roman people, and subsequently by other prelates outside of Rome, with no faithful person contradicting.

All this is further explained and strengthened by the example of the canonization of saints. Although the Pope, prior to the canonization of saints, relies on fallible processes which may contain falsehoods, yet in the very act of canonization he is led infallibly by the Holy Spirit and can never err. Similarly, we say that although the judgment about the papal election in its making may depend on fallible principles, the actual reception by the Church is guided by the infallible instinct of the Holy Spirit. Thus, the Church is governed so that she never accepted nor will accept an incapable person, nor will she accept anyone but a true Pontiff. Hence, in receiving a Pope, she cannot err. Thus, Gravina, John of St. Thomas, Passerinus (no. 20), and other theologians hold that it is de fide (of faith) that a Pope canonically elected in the face of the Church and received by the Church as such is a true Pope, the successor of Blessed Peter, having the fullness of power over God’s Church.

But what should be said if, after the election made by the Cardinals and the peaceful acceptance by the Church, some hidden nullity of the election is subsequently revealed? Could one then raise an exception of nullity?

**I respond negatively with Passerinus (no. 22). The reason is that laws nullifying and annulling a papal election are aimed at ensuring the freedom and security of the papal election, and especially at avoiding schisms. But if the Pope, elected in the face of the Church with the canonical form observed, is received by the universal Church, and only after this reception some awareness of a defect arises allowing someone to raise an exception and challenge the election, thereby expelling the elected, a great danger of schism would threaten the Church. Therefore, to avoid schisms, it is not permitted to raise an exception of nullity under the above hypothesis.**

Moreover, the universal and peaceful acceptance by the Church is like an infallible declaration of the election’s validity. Therefore, if a peaceful acceptance of the Pope by the Church exists, and afterwards some hidden defect comes to light, it is a sign that such a defect does not matter for the validity of the election. Otherwise, the Church could have erred in receiving the Pontiff, and no certainty of a legitimate Papacy could ever be had in the Church. We could doubt any Pope whatsoever, whether he was not baptized or had some other hidden defect making him not a legitimate Pope.

[...]

Nor does it stand that once the papal election and its peaceful acceptance by the Church have taken place, this Pope is a true Pope, but that he is not beyond deposition if a nullifying defect subsequently becomes evident from positive law.

I say this does not stand, because disputes and schisms must be eliminated by the Church so they do not endure forever. If the force of prescription is so strong as to make what was not one’s own become one’s own, they rightly proclaim that no appeal or objection is allowed against a judgment that has become res iudicata. Should the Church be constantly shaken by lawsuits and contentions, and should her head be subject to the violence of princes so that as often as the Pope stands as a wall for God’s house against princes, these princes under the pretext of nullity in the papal election can persecute the Pope? God forbid. Rather, the Church’s acceptance must be taken as a complete and public declaration of the election’s validity, against which no further objection is valid. Thus the Church can live peacefully under her Pastor, and the Pope can act vigorously without fear of princes and defend the Church’s jurisdiction by reproving vices and reforming morals.

Therefore, one must say that the ecclesiastical laws nullifying papal elections do not include the case of an election whose defect was so hidden that, notwithstanding it, the Pope was universally accepted by the Church as legitimate. Nor can it be asserted without error that a Pope chosen by the Church’s peaceful election is the true Pope yet is deposable if a hidden defect of nullity later emerges.

[...]

As for the third case, namely if the nullity of the election is only probable, even more probable, or most probable, I respond that in no way is it permitted to raise an exception, neither of law nor of fact, nor to depart in any manner from obedience, if the Pope is elected by two-thirds of the Cardinals. The reason is evident: no positive law introducing nullity against a Pope elected by two-thirds of the Cardinals in a doubtful case can prevail against the law of Alexander III contained in the Lateran Council chapter *Licet*, which prescribes that one elected by two-thirds of the Cardinals must be held as the true Pope, with no exception admissible. It is not to be presumed that subsequent laws would prejudice a conciliar law in a doubtful case. Therefore, where nullity is merely probable or even most probable, no exception may be raised, and so forth.

**Furthermore, if in such a hypothesis an exception were allowed, it would open the widest door to schisms and wars devastating the Church, and it would become easy to render the election of pontiffs doubtful. Hence, to remove all occasion of schisms, and so that no one can doubt the legitimacy of the papal election, in a doubtful case all exceptions must be avoided, and it was reasonably established by Alexander III at the Lateran Council that no exception can be brought against one elected by two-thirds of the Cardinals.**

[...]

But what is to be said if nullity arises from a defect in the natural consensus of two-thirds of the Cardinals?

I respond that if this defect is entirely certain and notorious, an exception can be raised both in law and fact. If, however, it is doubtful, **then before the universal acceptance by the Church, it must be decided according to common law, and an exception in law only would apply.** In that case, before a judgment by a General Council, the elected cannot be deposed from the Papacy nor can another Pope be elected.
