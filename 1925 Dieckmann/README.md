## Part II. On Dogmatic Facts

**834.** *Dogmatic facts* are historical truths which stand in an **external, contingent, historical relation to revealed doctrine**, not in a merely logical one. They are called *dogmatic* or *doctrinal* because they regard revealed Christian teaching and are intimately connected with dogma. Thus, although such facts **do not themselves belong to the deposit of revelation**, they **must be established with certainty** so that the deposit of faith and the Christian religion may be preserved intact; for example, **the legitimacy of an Ecumenical Council or of the Roman Pontiff**, in order that the truth of the dogma defined by him may be securely held. These are dogmatic facts in the **proper sense**.

**835.** In a broader sense any historical fact connected with dogma can be called dogmatic; in the strict and technical sense, a dogmatic fact is the **genuine sense of some human text or book**. About the broader sense there is no controversy: **unless the Church can indicate authentically and absolutely the legitimacy of a council or of the Roman Pontiff, the very doctrinal authority of the Church, and indeed all ecclesiastical authority, would collapse.** Otherwise the door would be opened to the gravest abuses and the Church, as a religious society, would necessarily succumb. Accordingly the Church actually proceeds in this way, presupposing as certain the legitimacy of Ecumenical Councils and of the canonically elected Pope. Thus, for example, the Council of Constance requires the faithful to profess that the condemnations of Wycliffe, Hus, and Jerome of Prague were rightly made and that *the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, is the successor of blessed Peter with supreme authority in the Church of God* (D 659, 674). Likewise, the Vatican Council’s definition of papal primacy and infallibility presupposes as an **undoubted fact** the legitimacy, universality, and supreme authority of the councils and popes it invokes.
