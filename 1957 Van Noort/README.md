## Section I, Chapter III, Article I

**89. Assertion 2: The Church's infallibility extends to dogmatic facts.**

This proposition is *theologically certain*.

A *dogmatic fact* is a *fact not contained in the sources of revelation, on the admission of which depends the knowledge or certainty of a dogma or of a revealed truth*. The following questions are concerned with dogmatic facts: "Was the Vatican Council a legitimate ecumenical council? Is the Latin Vulgate a substantially faithful translation of the original books of the Bible? **Was Pius XII legitimately elected bishop of Rome?" One can readily see that on these facts hang the questions of whether the decrees of the Vatican Council are infallible, whether the Vulgate is truly Sacred Scripture, whether Piux XII is to be recognized as supreme ruler of the universal Church.**

[...]

*Proof:*

1.\ From the *purpose of infallibility*. The Church is infallible in those related matters in which an error would constitute a danger to the faith. But dogmatic facts are matters of this kind. The reason should be obvious from the examples alleged above. What good would it do to proclaim in theory the infallible authority of ecumenical councils if one could licitly doubt the legitimacy of a specific council? What good would it do to acknowledge the inspiration of the Sacred Books in their original forms—forms long ago extinct—if one could not definitively establish the substantial fidelity of copies of the original, and of the translations which the Church has to use? Could Christians be effectively protected against errors in their faith if the Church could not warn them against poisonous fare, such as are books which contain heresy or errors in religious matters?

**90. Corollary**

The Church does not usually pass judgment directly on the dogmatic fact itself; but on the proposition which, through the medium of a dogmatic fact, is deduced from a revealed premise (either through a true reasoning process or through a merely explanatory syllogism). Of course, whatever the Church declares directly must be maintained by everyone, e.g., that the Vulgate contains the word of God; that Pius XII is head of the Church; that the doctrine of this or that book is heretical. It arrived at these decisions in the following manner: every faithful translation of the inspired books contains the words of God; but the Vulgate is a faithful translation: therefore. . . .  **Anyone legitimately elected bishop of Rome is head of the Church; but Pius XII was legitimately elected; therefore. . . .** Any book containing this doctrine is heretical; but such and such a book contains this doctrine; therefore. . . . Since then, the Church's decision is concerned more directly with the conclusion deduced from revelation with the help of a dogmatic fact, rather than with the dogmatic fact itself (which is assumed in the decision rather than directly affirmed), dogmatic facts can rightly be called not only secondary but also *indirect objects of infallibility*.
