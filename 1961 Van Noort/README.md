## Divine Faith, Chapter I, Article V, Assertion 2

Since it was established in the volume, *Christ's Church*, that the Church's infallible teaching power extends to matters *connected* with revelation and that its infallible authority deserves an *absolutely firm assent*, the only question which remains is what name to give that assent and how to describe its nature. These points will be discussed in just a moment.

Meantime, notice that the Church possesses infallibility not only when she is defining some matter in solemn fashion, but also when she is exercising the full weight of her authority through her ordinary and universal teaching. Consequently, we must hold with an absolute assent, which we call "ecclesiastical faith," the following theological truths: (a) those which the Magisterium has infallibly defined in solemn fashion; (b) those which the ordinary magisterium dispersed throughout the world unmistakably proposes to its members as something to be *held* (*tenendas*). So, for example, one must give an absolute assent to the proposition: **"Pius XII is the legitimate successor of St. Peter";** similarly (and as a matter of fact if this following point is something "formally revealed," it will undoubtedly be a dogma of faith) one must give an absolute assent to the proposition: "Pius XII possesses the primacy of jurisdiction over the entire Church." **For—skipping the question of how it begins to be proven infallibly for the first time that this individual was legitimately elected to take St. Peter's place—when someone has been constantly acting as pope and has theoretically and practically been recognized as such by the bishops and by the universal Church, it is clear that the ordinary and universal magisterium is giving an utterly clear-cut witness to the legitimacy of his succession.**

Nevertheless, the Church's testimony does differ vastly from every other sort of human testimony both by reason of its *dignity* and, above all, by its *certitude*—both of which factors accrue to it *extrinsically*. First, by its *dignity* because that testimony is given to execute the general duty imposed upon the Church by God; and secondly, by the certitude it brings: for every other sort of human testimony, of whatsoever kind, offers a certitude that is only strictly moral (i.e., having its foundation in the hypothesis of the human-moral order); whereas the testimony of the Church, by reason of the divine assistance guiding it, offers a metaphysical-moral certitude and it is, on this score, equivalent to divine testimony.

Since the Church's testimony differs in *kind* (species) both from divine testimony, by reason of its principle, and from human testimony, by reason of its certitude, it holds a kind of midway position between both types of testimony. There is then, good reason for acknowledging the existence of "ecclesiastical faith" which holds a position midway between divine faith and merely human faith and is specifically different from each of them. That is the reason also why many theologians in order to make a very clear distinction between divine and ecclesiastical faith (and also from a "religious assent," which will be discussed below) reserve the term "*to believe*" for matters of divine faith, whereas for assents of an inferior kind they use the term: "*to hold*" (*tenere vs. credere*).
