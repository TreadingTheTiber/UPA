## Sede Vacante, Chapter 7, Article 1, n. 10–11

**3. Whether a Heretic or a Schismatic or an Excommunicated Person Can Be Elected**

Heretics and schismatics can never be validly elected, since they are not members of the Church in the proper and strict sense. Indeed, they are subjects of the Church because they have been washed with the water of baptism, yet nonetheless they remain outside the mystical Body of Christ due to the guilt of heresy or schism (2). This doctrine, however, must be understood in such a way that the person chosen remains in heresy even after his nomination. For if, once the deed is done, he renounces his heresy or schism, we must undoubtedly consider the election valid.

There is no doubt that those who are suspended or irregular, as well as “tolerated” excommunicates, can be validly elected. The controversy concerns “to-be-avoided” excommunicates. At first glance, they would seem to be ineligible, since by judicial authority they are separated from the Body of the Church; but upon more careful consideration, it appears they are indeed eligible. This is because such separation or severance from the Mystical Body of Christ entirely depends on ecclesiastical authority, which can curtail or extend it, and likewise determine the effects accompanying it. Since no nullifying clause exists in canon law for such a case, one must necessarily conclude that the election of an excommunicate-to-be-avoided is valid in itself.

[...]

Formerly, there existed the faculty of objection against one elected simoniacally according to the Constitution *"Cum tam divino"* of Julius II, and likewise against one elected who was a heretic according to the Constitution "Cum ex Apostolo" of Paul IV. Today, however, no objection whatsoever can be made against one simoniacally elected, since simony, although prohibited by both divine and human law, nevertheless does not invalidate the election.

[...]

We inquire whether the true Pontiff is visible as an individual and specifically, such that we hold not only by faith that there is a Pontiff in the Church who has his seat in Rome, but also that this man, whom we see with our eyes, is that Pontiff.

Authors take three different positions on this matter.

1°\ Some believe that we recognize this person as the true Pontiff with only moral certainty. This opinion is held by Albertinus, Cajetan, and Corduba.

[...]

2°\ Some believe it to be a matter of faith that this man, whom the faithful follow with devotion and obedience as the head of the Church, is the true and legitimate Pontiff. Suárez professes this opinion, relying on reasons to be presented.

[...]

3°\ Finally, other authors teach that the legitimacy of a Pontiff as an individual is a theological fact, and therefore, is not to be believed by divine faith, but only by theological faith.

The arguments that the advocates of the latter opinion put forward are these:

a)\ The legitimate existence of a Pontiff in a specific individual cannot be an object of faith, since it is not divinely revealed, nor can it be an object of a simply moral certainty, since by its very nature it must exclude any doubt.

b)\ The recognition of a Pontiff in a specific individual is a fact intimately and necessarily connected with the perpetuity of primacy to be transferred to the legitimate successors of Peter. Indeed, facts that are connected with some divinely revealed truth are usually called theological. Therefore.

If the reasons brought forth by advocates on either side are examined more deeply, it becomes clearly evident that the third opinion differs from the second more in words than in substance. Indeed, the entire force of the question lies in clearly determining what is meant by the term *theological fact*, and what is actually the *material object* of divine faith. On this matter, the foremost authorities of dogmatic theology expound many things.

We profess the third opinion, **having entirely rejected the first, whose arguments are easily refuted. For from the fact that the existence of a true Pontiff in a specific individual is not revealed, it by no means follows that the same must be believed with only moral certainty; for besides divine faith in the strict sense and moral certainty, there exists theological faith or certainty. This addresses the first point.**

Regarding the second, we respond that the truth with which we are concerned does indeed depend on human testimony, just as faith depends on the preacher; however, this by no means prevents theological faith or certainty from flowing from it due to its necessary connection with dogma.

Regarding the fourth argument, we observe that it has never occurred throughout history that the entire Church has regarded as a true Pontiff one who in reality was not. It has indeed happened at times that many of the faithful did not recognize the true and certain pastor; but for the whole Church to unite behind a false head, namely believing someone to be the true Pope who was not truly so, has never occurred.

Concerning the third argument, there is no reason for us to discuss it, since it pertains only to the second opinion, not to the final one.
