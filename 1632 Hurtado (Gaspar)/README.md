## Disputatio XI, De Regulis Fidei, Difficultas XIII

[...]

The difficulty does not proceed concerning a Supreme Pontiff who has not yet been received peacefully by the Church in every respect; because there is present some prudent occasion for suspecting that his election is not legitimate, since in that case **it is not a matter of Faith that he is the true Pope**. But the difficulty proceeds only concerning **a Supreme Pontiff who has been received by the Church without suspicion and without any controversy**, as our Lord Urban VIII is now received—namely, whether **it should be believed by divine Faith that he is the true Pope**.

Turrecremata, book 4, *Summa*, §. 2, chapter 9; Albertus [Pighius] on *De agnoscendis assertionibus*, question 5; Cajetan 2. 2. question 1, article 3, in response to the 4th [objection]; Báñez, article 10, in his earlier commentary, doubt 2, to the 2nd [point]; Canon, book 6, *De locis*, final chapter; Vega on Trent, chapter 39; Córdoba, book 1, question 17; Castro, book 1, *Against Heresies*, chapter 9, and others up to twenty-seven Doctors teach that **it is not a matter of Faith that this particular man, or Pope—for example, Urban VIII (although received without controversy by the whole Church)—is the true Pope**, because **God has not revealed this**, and **what God has not revealed is not a matter of divine Faith**. This can be confirmed by the fact that **no one can be the true Pope who is not baptized**, but **it is not established as a matter of Faith that this man, or Pope, is baptized**; therefore, **it is not a matter of Faith that this man, or Pope, is the true Pope**.

This I publicly defended in the year of Our Lord 1601, having cited as an example Pope Clement VIII, who was then the Supreme Pontiff, in full view and light of all, in the Academy of Alcalá in the School of Theologians in the academic exercise called the *Magna* — which was one of nine exercises that the Academy then required for conferring the doctoral degree. [...] After the case was thoroughly examined by them, **we were declared entirely innocent and unharmed, and the doctrine itself was judged completely sound**.

Suarez, however, in disputation 10, section 5, and Petrus Hurtado [de Mendoza] in disputation 37, section 2, along with other more recent authors in their manuscripts, teach that **it is a matter of faith that this particular man, or Pope—for example, Urban VIII—is the true Pope**. This position is not without probability, because **this truth is immediately and in itself revealed by God**, not by express revelation, but by **confused revelation under this universal proposition**: *Peter and others who after him have been legitimately elected in the Christian Church are Popes, or Supreme Pontiffs, each in his own time.* Therefore, **it is a matter of faith that whoever in particular has been legitimately elected to the dignity of Peter is the true Pope**.

The consequence is evident, because for **the formal object or motive of divine faith, confused revelation suffices**, as we say in disputation 2, difficulty 4. But **this particular man, or Pope—for example, Urban VIII—who now presides over the Church was legitimately elected**; therefore, **it is a matter of faith that this particular man, or this Pope in particular—for example, Urban VIII—is the true Pope**.

This consequence is also evident, because **for something to be a matter of faith, it is not necessary that it be established by faith that this particular man—for example, Urban VIII—was legitimately elected**; rather, **it suffices that this be established by prudent human faith, as it truly is established, indeed most prudently**. For **it is a matter of faith that this particular infant—for example, Peter—has contracted original sin**, because this is confusedly revealed under the universal principle that **every descendant of Adam contracts original sin when he does not enjoy a divine privilege of exemption**, and it is established most prudently and with moral certainty that this infant—for example, Peter—descends from Adam and does not enjoy the privilege of exemption.

Just as, for something to be a matter of faith, **it is not necessary that it be a matter of faith that God has revealed it**; **it suffices that it be established by human faith that God has revealed it**, as we say in disputation 3, difficulties 3 and 4. From this, the response to our adversaries' argument is clear, and also to the confirmation, because **it is not necessary, for it to be a matter of faith that this particular man and Pope is baptized, that this be known by faith**; **it suffices that this be prudently established, as it truly can be**.
