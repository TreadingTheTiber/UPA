**2.** *It is a matter of faith that Benedict XIV, legitimately elected and accepted as such by the Church, is the true Pope, Vicar of Christ, and successor of Peter.* This is the most common view among Theologians. It is proven 1. from the Council of Constance, final session, where Martin V decrees that from those who return to the faith from heresy, among other things, it should be asked: Whether *they believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, with his proper name expressed, is the successor of Blessed Peter, having supreme authority in the Church of God?* Therefore, it supposes this to be an article of faith, since those abjuring heresy are questioned only about truths of faith. It is proven 2. The Catholic Church now existing is, by divine faith, the true Church: **Therefore, the Supreme Pontiff canonically elected, universally accepted, and venerated by the Church, is, as a matter of faith, the true Pontiff. No Catholic denies the antecedent: for Christ revealed that His Church would endure until the consummation of the world. The consequence is proven: the certainty regarding the existence of the head of a true and perfect body is the same as the certainty regarding the perfect existence of the true body itself: but by divine faith we are certain of the perfect existence of the body of the true Catholic Church founded by Jesus Christ: therefore, etc.**

[...]

**4.** This point is pressed further: that conclusion is of faith whose two premises are of faith; but this conclusion, *"Benedict XIV is the true Pontiff,"* follows from two premises of faith: therefore, etc. All Catholics concede the major premise. The minor is proven: the premises from which the said conclusion follows are these: *"Anyone legitimately elected as Pope and received as such by the Church"* is the true Pope; *"But Benedict XIV is such a one"*; these premises are therefore of faith; consequently, the conclusion deduced from them is also of faith. The major premise is indeed conceded by all; otherwise it would not be of faith that the legitimate successor of Peter is the true Pope. The minor premise is demonstrated thus: by the very fact that the Church receives Benedict XIV as legitimately elected, God reveals that his election is legitimate, because Christ promised that His Church would never err in matters of faith. But the Church would err in such a matter if the conclusion did not stand, since in acknowledging Benedict XIV as Pope, it acknowledges him as an infallible rule of faith, who, on the contrary supposition, would be a fallible rule. Therefore, etc. This is confirmed: by the very fact that God performs an evident miracle through the invocation of some confessor or martyr, or through veneration of their relics—so evident that it cannot be doubted in any way—He implicitly reveals that this person died in a state of grace. Why? Because (as all Catholic doctors maintain) it is repugnant to divine holiness to perform miracles at the invocation of one who is damned. Therefore, by the very fact that the Church (of which the Lord said it is the pillar and foundation of truth, and cannot err in matters of faith) has accepted Benedict XIV as the true Pontiff, and thus as an infallible rule of faith, God implicitly revealed that his election is legitimate. The consequence is clear: for just as it is repugnant to divine holiness to perform miracles at the invocation of the damned, so it is repugnant to divine faithfulness and providence concerning human salvation to permit the Church to err in matters of faith, which He promised would not err.

**5.** The conclusion is proven again: unless it were a matter of faith that the reigning Pope is the true Pope, successor of Peter, Head and Pastor of the Church, and Vicar of Christ, it would not be a matter of faith that the successor of Peter, Head and Pastor of the Church is the true Pope, nor that anyone is the true Pope. But the consequent is false and heretical; therefore, etc. The major premise is proven: the true Pastor and Head of the Church is a specific and singular man visibly existing in the Church, not someone vague, indeterminate, invisible, and unknown to the Church. But no one else can be this except Benedict XIV. Therefore, if he is not [the true Pope], there would be no one in the Church. Moreover, by divine faith we believe that the Council of Trent and other general Councils legitimately convened were true Councils defining dogmas of faith. But they could not be true Councils without a true Pope. Therefore, while by divine faith we believe they were true Councils, by the same divine faith we simultaneously profess that those specific Pontiffs who legitimately convened such Councils were true Popes. This is further explained: it is a matter of faith that only the true Pontiff can convene Councils, canonize Saints, and issue decrees binding in faith for all Christians. But Benedict XIV can do all these things, and all Christians are bound by faith to believe as a Saint whom he canonizes; to believe the decrees of faith emanating from him; and to accept as legitimate any Council he might convene, etc. Therefore, it is a matter of faith that he is the true Pope.

**6.** Furthermore, it is proven by another no less effective argument: **it is the heresy of the accursed Luther that a Pope canonically elected and universally received by the Roman Church is not the Vicar of Christ, nor the true successor of Peter; therefore, the opposite position is a matter of faith.** The consequence is evident: for if it is heresy to say, *"Christ is not true man,"* then the opposing proposition, *"Christ is true man,"* is and must be a matter of faith. Similarly, therefore, if it is a heresy of Luther and the Protestants that the Supreme Pontiff who is regarded by the Roman Church as the Vicar of Christ—as Benedict XIV is—is not truly such a Vicar of Christ, then the opposite proposition is and must be a matter of faith, namely, that the Supreme Pontiff who is regarded by the Roman Church as the Vicar of Christ—as Benedict XIV is—is truly such a Vicar of Christ.

**10.** This particular statement is confirmed not by any other reasoning: *Solomon sinned in Adam* is immediately of faith solely because it is contained in that universal proposition: *All sinned in Adam*. This containment is explained thus: *All children of Adam sinned in him*; *Solomon is a child of Adam*; therefore, *he sinned in him*. Similarly: *All true bread can be transubstantiated into the Body of Christ*; *but this bread is true bread*; therefore, *this bread can be transubstantiated into the Body of Christ*. Similarly: *Every infant rightly baptized obtains grace*; *but this infant baptized by me is rightly baptized*; therefore, *this infant is in a state of grace*. In these syllogisms, no one can deny the particular propositions established as consequences without falsifying those universal propositions revealed by God. Nor can anyone deny the assent of faith to these particulars without denying it to those universals. And precisely the same reasoning applies in our case; since God has revealed to the whole Church this universal proposition: *Every man rightly elected as successor of Peter is the Supreme Pontiff of the Church*, and furthermore **it is certainly established that Benedict XIV was rightly elected as successor of Peter; otherwise the Church would not be in peaceful acceptance, but would protest, as it often protested in the time of an Antipope; nor would Benedict XIV himself be in peaceful possession, as no one was during the time of an Antipope, until both renounced their claims and one of them, or another, was elected and peacefully declared by the Church itself.** Therefore, this particular proposition, *Benedict XIV is the Supreme Pontiff*, is immediately of faith. Wherefore, anyone who—supposing at least the moral evidence of the minor proposition from the peaceful possession of Benedict himself and the acceptance of the whole Church, by which it is established that he is contained under the subject of the major proposition—would deny such a particular proposition established as a consequence, could not help but deny that universal proposition; and consequently would act against the faith immediately and would be a heretic, just as in the aforementioned syllogisms.

[...]

**11.** Argument I. This proposition: *Benedict XIV is the true Pope* is not found in Sacred Scripture, neither explicitly nor implicitly; therefore, it is not a matter of faith. Response: I deny the antecedent, because it is contained in these Oracles: *The Church is the pillar and foundation of truth*; and, *You are Peter, etc.*; and, *The gates of hell shall not prevail*. From these it is inferred that the Church does not err when it acknowledges Benedict XIV as its legitimate head and true Pope. **For if the Church were to err in this matter, it could err in all other matters pertaining to faith, which is manifest heresy;** and it would not know that it has a true Head and Pastor, nor would it be sufficiently directed by the Holy Spirit in a matter of supreme and greatest importance; and thus God would not stand by His promises, nor would Christ Himself, etc., all of which are contrary to faith. Furthermore, even if this were in no way contained in Sacred Scripture, it is considered revealed by the very fact that the indefectible Church acknowledges the one elected as Supreme Pontiff.

[...]

**14.** Concerning other matters, to some Reverend Doctors it seems harsh to assert that, after the peaceful acceptance by the Church and the peaceful possession by the Supreme Pontiff, it is elevated to the certainty of faith that the elected person is baptized, ordained, that the Ministers had the proper intention, etc. Therefore, they defend that it is a matter of faith that *Benedict XIV is the Vicar of Christ*; and from this it is inferred, as a theological conclusion, that he is not a woman, that he is baptized, ordained, etc. But it is better to respond that there is no inconvenience in asserting that the aforementioned truths are also matters of faith, because by the very fact that God permits him to be rightly elected, and to be recognized by the Church as legitimately elected, and to be considered as such by himself, exercising the Pontifical dignity, God virtually reveals that he possesses all the requisites for the Papacy.

**15.** Argument 3: One who says "Benedict XIV is not the true Pope" would not be a heretic; therefore, it is not a matter of faith that he is such. I respond by distinguishing the antecedent: one who would say this before the Church's acceptance and peaceful possession [of the papacy] would not be a heretic, I concede; after acceptance and possession, I deny: because this would oppose the Council of Constance and the Decree of Martin V. And the Council of Florence has already defined that the Roman Pontiff canonically elected succeeds to the full power of St. Peter. Therefore, are some Catholics who defend the opposite conclusion heretics, and should they be denounced to the Supreme Tribunal of the Inquisition? Let them answer for themselves: For it is certain that they are not heretics if they deny this before peaceful possession and acceptance, while the Cardinal Electors are divided; but according to the most common opinion of Catholics, they are heretics and should be denounced—provided they do not, in good faith due to reasons that seem sufficient to them, believe that it is not an article of faith.

[...]

**18.** Some oppose our conclusion by pointing to several Popes who were intruded into the Pontificate. But this is not the question we are addressing; for our conclusion proceeds concerning one who is ritually and canonically elected. Indeed, certain intruders were completely abrogated and are not counted in the series of Pontiffs; some others are included in that series, but not for the time of their usurpation, but rather for the subsequent period in which, with the consent of the Electors having been added, they were elected as legitimate Pontiffs according to the customary rites. Hence it must be considered that an election is established as legitimate when the Catholic Church receives someone as a legitimate and undoubted Pontiff; for the consensus of the universal Church cannot be fallible. Thus, just as the Church cannot venerate as a Saint one who is not a saint, nor hold as a matter of faith something that is not of faith, so too it cannot be deceived in receiving as the true Pontiff, and as the certain rule of these matters, one who is not the true Pontiff and the true living rule.
