## Disputatio XVII, Sectio V, § 2: De Vero Pontifice Statuendo

[...]

**93.** Among the scholastics it was once disputed whether it is a matter of divine faith that this particular Pontiff, as acknowledged by the universal Church as such, is truly the successor of Blessed Peter; some affirming, others denying. Whatever may be said about this question, nearly all theologians hold that **at least it is theologically certain**. Even BÁÑEZ, who speculates about extraordinary cases, concludes that *"**it would be very rash and scandalous** if, after the Church has accepted someone as Supreme Pontiff, anyone should deny that he is the true Supreme Pontiff, unless he could show that he was not baptized, or was not a man."* It is further held that divine providence does not permit an unbaptized man to ascend even to the priesthood, much less to the Supreme Pontificate. 

[...]

**94.** **It is absolutely certain that the Church is infallible when she defines, or equivalently openly acknowledges, that this man—for example, PIUS IX—is truly Pope.** LUGO argues that the proposition *"this man is the true Pontiff"* is at least infallibly true, if not *de fide*: *"From divine revelation it is established that **the Church cannot be deceived in universally believing any error**, since she is the 'pillar and foundation of truth' (1 Tim. ii). In this infallibility of the universal Church is included that **the Church cannot err in recognizing the true visible rule of her faith**; for an error concerning the very rule of truth and faith would harm the Church more than an error concerning other particular objects, since it would be an error in the very foundation of faith. Since therefore **the visible rule which the Church follows in her faith is her visible head, the Supreme Pontiff**, whose teaching and definitions she must embrace, **the Church cannot be deceived by accepting as Pontiff and rule of faith one who would not truly be Pontiff nor rule of faith, but a pseudo-pope and private man."* [...]

**95. Objection I.** It is said that the major premise of LUGO's argument is false, namely, that the universal Church cannot believe any error, since she can, and in fact has often believed such.

**96. Response.** *I distinguish*: All the faithful, whether individually or collectively, can fall into error in matters that in no way pertain to religion (history, geography, astronomy, etc.): this is conceded. In matters pertaining to religion: *I distinguish again*. They can hold erroneous opinions as conjectures or merely free opinions: let this pass. But **they cannot err by holding something as a certain truth which all are bound to believe on the authority of the Church defining it**. **The Church cannot err in matters of faith "by holding something as of faith which is not, or by holding something not to be of faith which truly is"** (BÁÑEZ). What BÁÑEZ says about those things which immediately regard faith must be said, for the same reason, about those which regard it only mediately. VALENCIA, MELCHIOR CANO, GONZÁLEZ, and many others teach that such an error of the whole Church, even in something supposed to pertain to faith, would be incompatible with the Spirit of truth by whom the Church is always governed. **It is no less repugnant for the Church to deceive or be deceived while proposing something to be believed by all the faithful with the intention of obligating them, than for a prophet or evangelist writing under inspiration to deceive or be deceived.** [...]

**97. Objection II.** If a pseudo-pope were held as true pope, it is said, God would in any case infallibly provide for His Church.

**98. Response.** God indeed always provides for the Church, but **He does so through the very means which He Himself has established as perpetual and unshakeable**. The indefectibility of the Church rests on the fact that she is built upon the rock, that is, upon Peter and his successors. **Therefore the Church will never in fact be built upon any other foundation.**

**99. Objection III (pressed further).** In the case of a doubtful pope or of no pope at all, it is admitted that God provides for the Church in an extraordinary way.

**100. Response.** In the case imagined—**where a pseudo-pope would be held by all as the true and undoubted Pope**—there would be a **positive error of the universal Church**, believing as obligatory, and openly professing as sacred truth, what is entirely false. Indeed, there would be present, at least equivalently, **a definition of the Church that this one is the true Pope**, for such universal recognition is truly a definition. In the case, however, of a merely doubtful pope or of no pope, there is, by definition, **no such universal definition, no universal error, but only doubt or ignorance**. Here divine providence provides for the Church by seeing to it that, in due time, a certain and undoubted Pope is elected.
