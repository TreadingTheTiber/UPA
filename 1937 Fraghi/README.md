## Homo constituitur membrum Ecclesiae per baptismum validum

In this question it must always be kept in mind that **the Church is a supernatural society whose head, leader, and governor is Christ, who cannot permit that in the Church the majority would be invalidly baptized, or that the majority of priests would lack the power of orders; we say this a fortiori concerning Bishops.** Concerning these, *Saint Robert Bellarmine* states: "...I say that in Bishops two things are to be considered. First, that they hold the place of Christ.... Second, that they possess the power of orders and jurisdiction. If they are considered in the first way, **we are certain with infallible certitude that those whom we see are true Bishops and our Pastors. For this does not require either faith, or the character of orders, or legitimate election, but only that they be held as such by the Church....** If they are considered in the second way, we have only moral certitude that these are truly Bishops, although it is certain with infallible certitude that at least some are true, otherwise God would have abandoned the Church: but **for us to hold the Church as certain and conspicuous, as regards both heads and members, the first consideration suffices**" [^8].

Concerning the Supreme Pontiff, however, **it can by no means be admitted that someone invalidly baptized could ascend to the Roman Chair: our mind cannot even think this**: for **it is Jesus who assists His Church until the end of the world**. "*For — says Cardinal Billot — it will pertain to the infallible providence of God to ensure that the entire Church does not adhere to a false head, and consequently that no one is received as Supreme Pontiff who does not possess all the conditions of membership*" [^9].
