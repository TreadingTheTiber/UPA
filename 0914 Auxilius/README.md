## Invectiva in Romam pro Formoso Papa

[...] Therefore, because we have learned that in the holy Roman Church, which is the mother of all churches *having neither spot nor wrinkle* or any such thing, something new and unprecedented and unheard of in these times has recently occurred, we acknowledge it more with weeping than with disputation and waste away with excessive terror. **For the holy Roman Church, mother of all churches, is understood to remain in her proper state and not to be defiled by novelties that undermine the faith.**

Someone may perhaps say: Formosus lived excommunicated and despoiled, he was a usurper and an invader; the consecrations which he performed are null and void and he possessed nothing, he gave nothing. And we reply to these charges thus: *“As I live, says the Lord, this proverb shall no longer be used in Israel.”* Did the king and his nobles perchance lead Formosus to Rome with a military escort and, without the consent of the bishops and also of the senate and people of Rome, place him mitred upon the tribunal? Far from it. **The princes, phalanxes, and your satraps, the common people and your schools, from the greatest to the least, elected him, acclaimed him, praised him and venerated him, and the bishops together with the sacred Lateran order enthroned him. The entire world celebrated his renowned name; in the solemnities of the Mass throughout the whole world his name was proclaimed.** How therefore do you wish to extinguish the name of Formosus, which resounded through the three parts of the world and thundered to all from the rising of the sun to the limits of the earth? Does the name of Peter, Prince of the Apostles, stand? *Let also the name of his vicar Formosus stand.* Does the name of the apostolic ones remain, who held the place of blessed Peter? *Let also the name of Formosus remain.* Does the name of Nicholas, Adrian, Marinus, John, Stephen, and the rest flourish? *Let also the name of Formosus flourish.* **To deny the one whom the whole Church elected, acclaimed, and venerated as pope is to wound the very visibility and credibility of the Church.**
