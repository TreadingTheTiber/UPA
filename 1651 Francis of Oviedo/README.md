## Tractatus Primus, Controversia IV. Punctum VII.

[...]

**That a universal revelation suffices for believing singular things evidently contained under it is altogether certain among all theologians.** Let this be an example: God reveals that every man proceeding from Adam contracts original sin; it is evident that Peter is a man proceeding from Adam, from which it follows that **it is a matter of faith that Peter contracts original sin**, because there is no prudent reason why we should except him from original sin. [...] For it is the same to say "every man contracts original sin" as to say "Peter contracts original sin, John contracts original sin," etc., although in the universal revelation these individuals are not signified so distinctly, but confusedly on the part of the subject *every man*.

[...] 

Universal or confused revelation immediately attains the same object as singular and distinct revelation, and is distinguished from the latter only according to the mode of conceiving. 

[...]

Therefore, since on account of universal revelation a particular thing explicated through its determinate knowledge is believed by an act of faith, then **the act of faith is not said to depend upon two premises, one revealed and the other not revealed; rather, through a particular proposition the subject of revelation is explicated and distinctly known, and is believed by a distinct act of faith.** [...] **Nor is it necessary for this that we believe by faith that this individual is a human being, in order that we believe by the same faith that he contracted sin; rather it suffices that he be evidently known to be a human being**, because, as Hurtado rightly notes in disputation 11, §20, the subject concerning which something is revealed is presupposed as known by the light of nature, and afterwards it is believed by an act of faith that the revealed predicate pertains to it.

**A difficulty of the gravest importance arises in this matter, namely whether by virtue of universal revelations**—by which it is revealed that every man legitimately elected as the lawful Pontiff of the Church is Peter's successor in office and authority and the true Pope, and that every Council legitimately assembled possesses infallible authority and is assisted by the Holy Spirit in matters pertaining to the Church—**it is also revealed that this particular Pope, for example Innocent X, is the true Pope**, and that this particular Council, for example the Council of Trent, is legitimate and treated the affairs of the Church and defined truths pertaining to the faith with the assistance of the Holy Spirit. **The question does not concern a Pontiff and Council not yet received by the Church**, concerning which it is still disputed whether the recent election and assembly were legitimate, **but rather concerns a Pontiff and Council which the universal Church has received and which peacefully possess authority among the faithful.**

In favor of the negative opinion stand Torquemada [...] Cajetan [...] Melchior Cano [...] Domingo Báñez, 2a 2ae, question 1, article 10, doubt 2, response to the 2nd objection, where he affirms that **this particular Pontiff being the true Pope is certain only with moral certainty**. [...] Moreover, Cardinal Bellarmine, tome 1, treatise *De Conciliorum authoritate*, chapter 9, in response to the final objection, says that **we hold the Council of Nicaea and Ephesus to have been legitimately convoked only by natural evidence or human faith, and that this suffices for what was defined by them to be held as matters of faith**.

**That it is a matter of faith that this particular Pope is the true Pope**, and that this particular Council received without hesitation by the entire Church—for example, the Council of Trent—is a true Council, **is defended by all the Doctors of this age: no one has dared to assert the opposite since the time of Clement VIII**, when this matter was gravely controverted on the occasion of Father Gaspar Hurtado [...] For this reason, both he and others who subscribed to the same opinion were summoned to Rome by Clement VIII, although the matter was settled in Spain [...]

Let the conclusion be: **in order that what the Pontiff defines may be of the faith and believed by faith, it is not necessary to believe by faith, or for it to be of the faith, that this particular individual Pontiff is the Pontiff.** [...] **That which is not the formal reason for believing, but only a condition, need not necessarily be believed by divine faith**, but it suffices that it be otherwise prudently judged—so runs the common opinion of the Doctors. [...] Therefore, in order that we may believe by an act of faith those things which are defined by a Pontiff admitted throughout the whole Church, **it suffices that the divine revelation be applied**—which revelation is the motive for believing—**by a Pontiff whom it is established with moral certainty and most prudent judgment to be the true Pontiff, even if it were not certain with the certitude of faith**.

[...] even though it were not a matter of faith that this particular man is the Pontiff, **because nevertheless this cannot be prudently doubted by anyone, but all must judge him to be the true Pontiff**, and since so judging is necessary lest one deny that his definitions are to be believed by an act of faith, **by the same precept by which we are bound to believe by an act of faith the object defined by the Pope as an article of faith, we are bound to judge that he is the true Pope**, at least by a natural act, if a supernatural motive does not subsist for judging this by an act of faith.

Notwithstanding these things, **I stand by the opinion affirming that this particular man, for example Innocent X, is the true Pope**, and that this particular Council, for example the Council of Trent, **are objects to be believed with divine faith**. The reason is that, although this is not necessary for believing with divine faith the objects defined by the Pontiff or Council, according to this opinion **the infallibility of definitions is more sincerely defended and more clearly explained** [...]

Moreover, **if it were not a matter of faith that this particular man is the true Pope**, nor a matter of faith that his predecessor was such, and thus concerning the entire past succession of Pontiffs it were not a matter of faith that they were legitimate Popes, **then the whole certainty of the true Church would collapse**, for if the Pontiffs were not legitimate, neither would the Bishops and Priests be legitimate. [...] Furthermore, **it would not be a matter of faith that there exists a true Church, which depends entirely upon one head**, without whom Councils would have no validity. [...] Additionally, in the Councils—especially in the Bull of Martin V at the Council of Constance—**it is laid down that the very first thing to be required of heretics who wish to be reconciled to the Catholic Church is that they believe that the Pope canonically elected, whoever he may be at the time, his name being expressly stated, is the successor of Peter and possesses supreme power in the Church**: therefore, according to the mind of the Councils, and especially of Martin V in the aforesaid Bull, **this must be believed as a matter of faith**.

**I hold, moreover, that by the very fact that this particular Pope has been received by the whole Church, it must be believed with the certitude of faith that he is a true Pontiff, even before he defines anything.** The reason is that **the entire motive for believing this truth subsists prior to any definition**, for before this there exists the universal revelation for all Popes legitimately elected, and **there is moral evidence that this particular Pope, having been received by the whole Church, is contained in the universal revelation**, or is one of those for whom the revelation was made, **which suffices for an act of faith**.

To understand this doctrine, **it is necessary to distinguish two things which almost everyone confounds; namely, that it is one thing for this man to be legitimately elected to the Pontificate, and another thing to be the true Pontiff.** The first signifies being capable of passive election, and being elected by those in whose hands lies the authority to elect, with all the requisites for the election. The second is to possess the Pontifical authority given by God, the election being presupposed, and the special assistance of the Holy Spirit. From these considerations, therefore, **the first is morally evident by reason of the testimony of the Church, yet it is not revealed**, nor is it necessary to believe it by divine faith; **but after it is believed on account of the moral evidence arising from the consent of the whole Church and the special assistance of God toward His Church, it is then believed by an assent of faith that he is the true Pope, because it has been revealed that everyone legitimately elected is the true Pope**.

You will object: even if it has been revealed that everyone legitimately elected is a true Pope, it is not established that this man, who now presides over the Church, has been legitimately elected, because concerning this in particular there is no revelation, nor is it evident to us that he is capable of the pontifical dignity, because it is not established whether he was ritually baptized [...]

I respond that **it has been revealed that this Pontiff, having been received by the entire Church in this number, is a legitimate Pontiff**—not by any singular revelation specially given for him individually, but by universal revelation made for all. **This is established with moral certitude and evidence from the fact that he has been peacefully received by the entire Church.** From this it becomes morally evident that he is baptized, and in every respect capable of the pontifical dignity, and legitimately elected, and consequently that he is comprehended by the universal revelation [...] **For although perhaps it may not be contradictory for a man otherwise incapable to be elected Pontiff, it is contradictory for such a one to be peacefully received by the entire Church**: for **from the ordinary and special providence of God it must be believed that the election of a person incapable of the pontifical dignity would be impeded**, and granted that an incapable person were elected, **it must be believed that the defect would be manifested before he is peacefully received by the universal Church**. **For if, on account of the special assistance of the Holy Spirit, it is contradictory for a true Pontiff to define something false, much better from the same principle will it be contradictory for the entire Church to acknowledge an illegitimate Pontiff as true.** [...] It must be added that **impediments introduced by human law to the pontifical dignity are removed, or dispensed by the Church if any such exist in him who is assumed to the supreme Pontificate by election**, or by the very fact that he is elected.

You will object secondly: The Church erred in thinking that the marriages of eunuchs were legitimate [...] therefore in the same manner she could err in judging that this particular Pope is legitimate [...]

I respond: **The Church never positively declared that the marriages of eunuchs were legitimate, but rather by passing over them in silence she permitted them**, in which there was no error [...] **But in regard to the Pope, the Church conducts herself positively, and by the very election and by the common reception of all the faithful she testifies that he is the true Pope.**

You will object thirdly: a legitimate Pontiff can fall into heresy [...] by committing this crime he would fall from his dignity and would not be a true Pontiff. Nevertheless, such a one would commonly be regarded by the whole Church in the same way as before he fell into heresy. Therefore, **the whole Church can err by rendering the worship due to a true Pontiff to a man who is not in fact a true Pontiff**.

I respond that it is true that the Pontiff can fall into heresy [...] Nevertheless, **one who has thus fallen into heresy does not fall from his dignity, but retains it and remains the true Pontiff until the crime of heresy committed by him is declared by the Church**. So hold Báñez, Cajetan, Soto, Cano, Córdoba, and Valentia [...]

You will object 4. It has sometimes happened in the Church that certain men were considered true Pontiffs who were not such: therefore the Church can err in proposing who is the true Pontiff.

I respond that **all schisms frequently arise before the Pontiff has been received as such by the universal Church, and never after the entire Church has admitted a man elected to the pontifical dignity as the true Pontiff**, and Christian Princes and the entire commonwealth of Catholics have without any hesitation rendered obedience to someone as the true Pontiff, **has there arisen a prudent reason for doubting concerning his legitimate dignity**.
