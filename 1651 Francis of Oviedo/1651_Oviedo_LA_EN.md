| *An reuelatio vniuersalis sufficiat ad credendum actu fidei singularia euidenter in vniuersali contenta? Vbi an sit de fide hunc numero Papam esse Papam.* | | *Whether a universal revelation suffices for believing by an act of faith singular things evidently contained in the universal? Where it is asked whether it is a matter of faith that this particular Pope is Pope.* |
| **76** VNiuersalem reuelationem sufficere ad credendum singularia euidenter sub illa contenta apud omnes Theologos est omnino certum. Exemplum sit : Reuelat Deus ; omnem hominem ex Adamo procedentem contrahere originale peccatum : euidens est Petrum esse hominem ex Adamo procedentem, quo sit esse de fide Petrum contrahere originale peccatum, quia nulla est prudens ratio, vt eum ab originali excipiamus : fide ergo diuina credimus Petrum contrahere originale peccatum, quia reuelatum est hoc obiectum immediatè in se ipso reuelatione vniuersali, quæ est immediata de omnibus particularibus, & de vnoquoque illorum, licèt non de vnoquoque adæquatè, sed inadæquatè, quia non vnum tantum singulare, sed omnia continentur in reuelatione; idem enim est dicere : omnis homo contrahit originale peccatum, ac dicere : Petrus contrahit originale peccatum, Ioannes contrahit originale, &c. licèt in reuelatione vniuersali, hæc indiuidua non ita distinctè, sed confusè ex parte subiecti *omnis homo* significentur. | | **76** That a universal revelation suffices for believing singular things evidently contained under it is altogether certain among all theologians. Let this be an example: God reveals that every man proceeding from Adam contracts original sin; it is evident that Peter is a man proceeding from Adam, from which it follows that it is a matter of faith that Peter contracts original sin, because there is no prudent reason why we should except him from original sin. Therefore, by divine faith we believe that Peter contracts original sin, because this object has been revealed immediately in itself by a universal revelation, which is immediate concerning all particulars and concerning each one of them, although not concerning each one adequately, but inadequately, because not one singular alone, but all are contained in the revelation. For it is the same to say "every man contracts original sin" as to say "Peter contracts original sin, John contracts original sin," etc., although in the universal revelation these individuals are not signified so distinctly, but confusedly on the part of the subject *every man*. |
| **77** Distinguuntur etiam reuelatio vniuersalis, seu confusa, & reuelatio mediata, seu remota, ex eo quod vniuersalis, seu confusa immediatè attingit idemmet obiectum, quod singularis, & distincta, & tantum ab hac distinguitur ex modo concipiendi. Mediata autem non attingit idemmet obiectum, quod immediata; immediata enim attingit obiectum in seipso ; mediata autem non in seipso, sed in aliquo, quod ex illo infertur, veluti cum reuelatur Christum esse hominem, reuelatio terminatur ad ea, quæ substantialiter hominem constituunt, & ex eo quod ad hæc terminetur, dicitur reuelatio mediata omnium, quæ ex illis inferuntur per veram causalitatem, sic dicitur ex eo, quod reuelatum sit Christum esse hominem esse mediatè reuelatum esse risibilem. Pono modo rei explicandæ causa risibilitatem esse passionem physicè distinctam ab humanitate, vel quoduis accidens distinctum, & inseparabile naturaliter ab humanitate, loco risibilitatis substitue, hoc autem quod est esse mediatè reuelatum in re non est, esse reuelatum, sed inferri necessario ex illo, quod reuelatum est. | | **77** Universal or confused revelation and mediate or remote revelation are also distinguished from one another in that universal or confused revelation immediately attains the same object as singular and distinct revelation, and is distinguished from the latter only according to the mode of conceiving. Mediate revelation, however, does not attain the same object as immediate revelation; for immediate revelation attains the object in itself, whereas mediate revelation does not attain it in itself, but in something that is inferred from it. For example, when it is revealed that Christ is man, the revelation is terminated at those things which substantially constitute man, and from the fact that it is terminated at these things, it is called a mediate revelation of all those things which are inferred from them through true causality. Thus it is said that from the fact that it has been revealed that Christ is man, it has been mediately revealed that He is risible [capable of laughter]. I posit now, for the sake of explaining the matter, that risibility is a property physically distinct from humanity, or any distinct accident naturally inseparable from humanity—in place of risibility substitute this. But this notion of being mediately revealed is not in reality the same as being revealed, but rather is necessarily inferred from that which has been revealed. |
| **78** Dixi mediatè reuelari, quæ per veram causalitatem inferuntur, ex immediatè reuelatis: ea enim, quæ tantùm inferuntur logicè, & physicè inter se identificantur, non mediatè, sed immediatè reuelata dicuntur, quando eorum alterum reuelatum est. Sic ex eo quod sit reuelatum Christum esse hominem, immediatè reuelatum est esse animal rationale, & constare corpore, & anima, quia physicè, & realiter esse hominem, esse animal rationale, esse constans corpore, & anima, sunt omnino idem, & tantum distincta per diuersos modos significandi, quapropter hæc omnia eadem fidei certitudine constant. Ratio autem propter quam eadem fide credenda sunt ea, quæ confusè tanquam partes totius, vel tanquam singularia respectu vniuersalis, ac creduntur distinctè, & expressè reuelata est, quia hæc distinctio confusi, seu distincti non se tenet ex parte obiecti reuelati, sed tantum ex parte modi illa concipiendi, imo non ex parte modi, quo ea concipit Deus reuelans, sed quo nos talia obiecta apprehendimus, quia Deus nihil confusè apprehendit. | | **78** I have said "mediately revealed" concerning those things which are inferred by true causality from what is immediately revealed: for those things which are only inferred logically and are physically identified with each other are not called mediately but immediately revealed, when one of them has been revealed. Thus from the fact that it is revealed that Christ is a man, it is immediately revealed that He is a rational animal and consists of body and soul, because physically and really to be a man, to be a rational animal, to be consisting of body and soul, are entirely the same, and are only distinguished by diverse modes of signifying; wherefore all these things stand with the same certitude of faith. Moreover, the reason why those things must be believed with the same faith which are believed confusedly as parts of a whole, or as singulars in relation to a universal, as things revealed distinctly and expressly, is that this distinction between the confused and the distinct does not hold on the part of the revealed object, but only on the part of the mode of conceiving them—indeed, not on the part of the mode by which God the Revealer conceives them, but by which we apprehend such objects, because God apprehends nothing confusedly. |
| **79** Ex his inferes, quotiescumque infertur conclusio ex vna præmissa reuelata, & alia lumine naturæ nota, conclusionem esse de fide, si præmissa reuelata confusè continet obiectum præmissæ lumine naturæ notæ, veluti in hoc syllogismo: Omnis homo descendens ex Adamo contrahit originale: Petrus est homo descendens ex Adamo: ergo Petrus contrahit originale. Obiectum huius conclusionis est de fide, quia minor confusè continetur in maiori, non mediatè, sed immediatè, dum enim dicitur omnis homo descendens ex Adamo contrahit originale, idem est, ac dicere: Petrus descendens ex Adamo contrahit originale: Ioannes descendens ex Adamo contrahit, &c. Minor enim prædicti syllogismi tantum explicat suum obiectum contentum esse in subiecto maioris, qua ratione illi applicat reuelationem afficientem obiectum maioris propositionis. Ex quo constat obiectum minoris esse reuelatum, & fieri obiectum proximum, & expeditum ad terminandum actum fidei. Sic explicui controuers. 10. Logicæ punct. 3. ex P. Tanner. ibi citato, apud 1. partem, quod etiam hic docet disputat. 1. quæst. 1. dub. 3. Idem docent Soarius disputat. 3. sect. 11. num. 5. Valentia disp. 1. quæst. 1. punct. 2. Vterque Hurtad. Complut. disp. 2. diff. 4 Salmant. disp. 11. sect. 2. Vasq. 1. parte, disp. 5. cap. 3. & disput. 135. num. 6. vbi dicit non inferri propositionem singularem ex vniuersali, sed in illa contineri. Idem tradunt Aureol. Scot. Can. & Vega apud Puente Hurtado, & passim omnes Doctores. | | **79** From these points you may infer that whenever a conclusion is drawn from one revealed premise and another known by the light of nature, the conclusion is a matter of faith, provided that the revealed premise confusedly contains the object of the premise known by the light of nature, as in this syllogism: Every man descending from Adam contracts original sin; Peter is a man descending from Adam; therefore Peter contracts original sin. The object of this conclusion is a matter of faith, because the minor premise is confusedly contained in the major, not mediately but immediately, for when it is said that every man descending from Adam contracts original sin, it is the same as saying: Peter descending from Adam contracts original sin; John descending from Adam contracts it, etc. For the minor premise of the aforesaid syllogism only makes explicit that its object is contained in the subject of the major premise, by which reasoning it applies to it the revelation affecting the object of the major proposition. From this it is established that the object of the minor premise is revealed, and becomes a proximate and expedited object for terminating an act of faith. Thus I explained controversy 10 of the Logic, point 3, from Father [Adam] Tanner cited there, in the first part, which he also teaches here in disputation 1, question 1, doubt 3. The same is taught by [Francisco] Suárez, disputation 3, section 11, number 5; [Gregorio de] Valencia, disputation 1, question 1, point 2; both [Gaspar and Diego] Hurtado [de Mendoza]; the Complutenses, disputation 2, difficulty 4; the Salmanticenses, disputation 11, section 2; [Gabriel] Vázquez, first part, disputation 5, chapter 3, and disputation 135, number 6, where he says that a singular proposition is not inferred from a universal, but is contained in it. The same is handed down by [Petrus] Aureolus, [Duns] Scotus, [the Carmelites of] Salamanca, and [Andrés de] Vega as cited by [Diego] Puente Hurtado, and by all the Doctors passim. |
| **80** Cum ergo propter reuelationem vniuersalem actu fidei creditur singulare explicatum per illius cognitionem determinatam, tunc actus fidei non dicitur dependere ex duabus præmissis, vna reuelata, & alia non reuelata, sed per propositionem particularem explicari, & distinctè cognosci reuelationis subiectum distinctè actu fidei creditur. Habemus enim de fide *omnem hominem* (excipienda semper est Beatissima Virgo Deipara) contraxisse originale: postea cum dicimus: *Petrus est homo*, explicatur, & secernitur subiectum maioris vniuersalis, & cognoscimus in illo Petrum contineri, & ideo de Petro credimus actu fidei, quod de omni homine in maiori enunciamus. Neque ad hoc est necessarium, vt fide credamus hoc indiuiduum esse hominem, vt eadem fide credamus contraxisse peccatum, sed sufficit euidenter cognosci hominem esse, quia vt benè notat Puent. Hurtad. disput. 11. §. 20. subiectum, de quo aliquid reuelatur naturæ lumine cognitum supponitur, & postea actu fidei prædicatum reuelatum illi conuenire creditur. | | **80** Therefore, since on account of universal revelation a particular thing explicated through its determinate knowledge is believed by an act of faith, then the act of faith is not said to depend upon two premises, one revealed and the other not revealed; rather, through a particular proposition the subject of revelation is explicated and distinctly known, and is believed by a distinct act of faith. For we hold from faith that *every human being* (the Most Blessed Virgin Mother of God must always be excepted) contracted original sin; afterwards when we say: *Peter is a human being*, the subject of the major universal is explicated and distinguished, and we know that Peter is contained in that universal, and therefore we believe concerning Peter by an act of faith what we enunciate concerning every human being in the major premise. Nor is it necessary for this that we believe by faith that this individual is a human being, in order that we believe by the same faith that he contracted sin; rather it suffices that he be evidently known to be a human being, because, as Hurtado rightly notes in disputation 11, §20, the subject concerning which something is revealed is presupposed as known by the light of nature, and afterwards it is believed by an act of faith that the revealed predicate pertains to it. |
| **81** Quod si quis euidentia physica falsò iudicaret aliquod indiuiduum esse hominem quia in illo omnia accidentia hominis intuebatur, non posset de illo credere actu fidei contraxisse peccatum originale, non quia deficiebat applicatio: hæc enim prudens erat ad credendum, sed quia deficiebat obiectum formale fidei, quod benè notauit Puent. Hurt. ibidem; existimaret ergo ille hominem teneri ad credendum actu fidei indiuiduum, quod hominem iudicabat, contraxisse originale, quapropter si oppositum asseruisset, peccaret ex conscientia erronea. | | **81** But if anyone should falsely judge by physical evidence that some individual is a man because he perceived in that individual all the accidents of man, he could not believe by an act of faith that it had contracted original sin—not because the application was lacking (for this was a prudent basis for believing), but because the formal object of faith was lacking, which Puentius Hurtado rightly noted in the same place. Therefore, he would consider that man to be bound to believe by an act of faith that the individual, which he judged to be a man, had contracted original sin; wherefore, if he were to assert the opposite, he would sin from an erroneous conscience. |
| **82** Existimauit Valentia modo citatus hanc applicationem reuelationis per præmissam naturaliter notam, tantum contingere, quando præmissa reuelata est vniuersalis, & naturaliter nota est particularis, vt contingit in syllogismo adducto: *omnis homo ex Adamo descendens*, &c. Rectè autem notauit Soarius ibidem aliquando etiam inferri conclusionem de fide ex maiori lumine naturæ nota, & minori reuelata, veluti in hoc syllogismo *omnis homo constat corpore, & Anima; Christus est homo: ergo Christus constat corpore, & anima*. Cuius consequens reuelatum fuit, cum reuelatum est obiectum minoris. Id tamen explicat maior propositio, qua ostenditur identitas inter hoc, quod est esse hominem, & hoc, quod est constare corpore, & anima, & consequenter reuelationem expressè, & distinctè applicat ad hoc obiectum *Christus constat corpore, & anima*, & illud nobis reddit proximè credibile actu fidei. | | **82** The aforementioned Valentia held that this application of revelation through a naturally known premise only occurs when the revealed premise is universal and the naturally known premise is particular, as happens in the syllogism adduced: *every man descending from Adam*, etc. However, Suárez rightly noted in the same place that sometimes a conclusion of faith is also inferred from a major premise known by the light of nature and a minor premise revealed, as in this syllogism: *every man consists of body and soul; Christ is man: therefore Christ consists of body and soul*. The consequent of this was revealed when the object of the minor premise was revealed. Nevertheless, the major proposition explains this, by which is shown the identity between this—that is, being man—and this—that is, consisting of body and soul—and consequently applies the revelation expressly and distinctly to this object, *Christ consists of body and soul*, and renders it to us proximately credible by an act of faith. |
| **83** Placet etiam aduertere in omnibus syllogismis, quorum conclusionem dicimus esse de fide tantum nos intendere, obiectum conclusionis posse credi propter reuelationem, quam discursus formalis applicat, seu ostendit, non vero ipsam conclusionem formalem, vt talem esse fidei actum, quia conclusio formalis deducta, vt formæ syllogisticæ, numquam est fidei actus, cum fides discursiua non sit. Sic rem defendit Cardinalis de Lugo disput. 1. sect. 13. §. 3. | | **83** It is also appropriate to note that in all syllogisms whose conclusion we say is a matter of faith only, we intend that the object of the conclusion can be believed by reason of revelation, which formal reasoning applies or demonstrates, but not that the formal conclusion itself, as such, is an act of faith, because a formal conclusion deduced according to the form of a syllogism is never an act of faith, since faith is not discursive. Cardinal de Lugo defends this position in disputation 1, section 13, §3. |
| **84** Occurrit difficultas in hac materia grauissimi momenti, videlicet an vi reuelationum vniuersalium, quibus reuelatum est omnem hominem legitimè electum in Ecclesiæ legitimum Pontificem esse Petri successorem in munere, & authoritate, & verum Papam, & omne Concilium legitimè congregatum habere infallibilem authoritatem, eique Spiritum sanctum assistere in rebus ad Ecclesiam pertinentibus sit reuelatum hunc numero Papam v. g. Innocent. X. esse verum Papam, & hoc numero Concil. v. g. Trident. esse legitimum, & Spiritus sancti assistentia Ecclesiæ negotia tractasse, & veritates ad fidem pertinentes definiisse. Non procedit quæstio de Pontifice, & Concilio, nondum ab Ecclesia receptis, de quibus adhuc controuertitur, an electio, & congregatio recentes sint legitimæ, sed de Pontifice, & Concilio, quæ vniuerfim Ecclesiæ recepit, & pacificè apud fideles authoritatem possident. | | **84** A difficulty of the gravest importance arises in this matter, namely whether by virtue of universal revelations—by which it is revealed that every man legitimately elected as the lawful Pontiff of the Church is Peter's successor in office and authority and the true Pope, and that every Council legitimately assembled possesses infallible authority and is assisted by the Holy Spirit in matters pertaining to the Church—it is also revealed that this particular Pope, for example Innocent X, is the true Pope, and that this particular Council, for example the Council of Trent, is legitimate and treated the affairs of the Church and defined truths pertaining to the faith with the assistance of the Holy Spirit. The question does not concern a Pontiff and Council not yet received by the Church, concerning which it is still disputed whether the recent election and assembly were legitimate, but rather concerns a Pontiff and Council which the universal Church has received and which peacefully possess authority among the faithful. |

The same opinion was taught by Diego de Arce, Theological Reader, 2a 2ae, question 1, article 10; Master Mancio (de Corpus Christi), *Quaestio de authoritate Papae*, response to the 3rd objection. The same is presupposed there by our most learned Deza, the first public reader of Theology in this Complutensian college, doubt 1, *De potestate Pontificis*, just before the solution of the arguments, where he says that it could be evident to someone that this particular Pontiff is not the true Pope, because he baptized him without the intention. The same conclusion was formerly defended by Father Gaspar Hurtado, at that time a colleague of Don Ildefonso in this University of the Greatest College, in the solemn disputations customarily held in the university for the conferral of the doctoral degree. To this conclusion subscribed in their official capacity Doctor Gregory de la Cámara, Dean of this university, and Doctor Don Álvaro de Villegas, regent of the evening chair of Theology. Afterward Father Gabriel Vázquez and Father Francisco de Torres subscribed. Moreover, Cardinal Bellarmine, tome 1, treatise *De Conciliorum authoritate*, chapter 9, in response to the final objection, says that we hold the Council of Nicaea and Ephesus to have been legitimately convoked only by natural evidence or human faith, and that this suffices for what was defined by them to be held as matters of faith. Father Gregorio de Valencia, 2a 2ae, disputation 1, question 1, point 7, in the 5th small question, §. 39, admits as probable that someone not baptized, or incapable by divine law, could be elected Supreme Pontiff. |
| **86** De fide esse hunc numero Papam esse verum Papam, & hoc numero Concilium ab omni Ecclesia, absque hæsitatione receptum v. g.

For this reason, both he and others who subscribed to the same opinion were summoned to Rome by Clement VIII, although the matter was settled in Spain, as Hurtado himself relates in disputation 11, difficulty 13. Therefore, those affirming this position are: Cardinal de Lugo, disputation 1, section 3, §5, number 316; Suárez, disputation 5, section 8, number 1, and disputation 10, section 5; Tanner, disputation 1, question 1, doubt 5, number 146; Castro Palao, tome 1, treatise 4, point 5, §2; Puente Hurtado, disputation 11, section 3, and disputation 37, throughout. Gregory Hurtado also considers this probable in disputation 11, difficulty 13. Salmerón, Albertinus, Valencia, and Lorca are cited by Suárez in the aforementioned place, §disputation, and by Palao; Bonacina, Aragon, Luis de León, Master Guevara, and Doctor Andreas Marmol. Also cited by Báñez and others are certain individuals asserting that it is not a matter of faith that this particular Pontiff is the Pontiff until he defines something or celebrates the canonization of some saint; but after he has performed one of these acts, it is then a matter of faith that this particular Pontiff is the Pontiff. |
| **87** Sit conclusio: ad hoc vt quæ Pontifex definit sint de fide, & fide credantur, necesse non est fide credere, aut de fide esse hunc numero Pontificem esse Pontificem. Ita expressè Bellarm. supra citatus, & Bannez,qui respondet argumento, quo ex sua inferri sententia probari intenditur non esse fide credenda ea, quæ à Pontificibus, aut Conciliis definiuntur, & omnes authores,qui negant,de fide esse hunc numero Pontificem esse verum Pontificem,aut hoc numero Concilium esse verum Concilium,hi enim nunquam admittent non esse de fide ea,quæ definita sunt à Tridentino,& Innocentio X. quod absque errore in fide dici non posset. Moueor ad hoc, quia testimonium Pontificis, aut Concilij non est formalis ratio credendi, sed applicatio testimonij Dei, seu reuelationis aliàs factæ à Deo,quæ extat in scriptura,aut constat ex traditione;ea enim,quæ Pontifex, aut Concilia definiunt, vt fide credenda aliàs erant reuelata, & tunc incipiunt esse de fide; non quia tunc primò reuelentur,sed quia sufficienter,& efficaciter applicatur reuelatio infallibili quadam regula,qua applicatione posita tenemur credere obiectum definitum ob definitionem,tanquam conditionem,& ob reuelationem aliàs à Deo factam,tanquam ob rationem formalem. Id autem, quod non est ratio formalis credendi, sed tantum conditio, non debet credi fide diuina. Id quod non est obiectum formale fidei, sed tantum conditio non esse necessario actu fidei credendum, sed sufficit alias prudenter iudicari, fert communis Doctorum sententia. Testimonium Pontificis non esse rationem formalem credendi actu fidei, docet Molina 1. part. quæst. 1. art. 2. disp. 1. & 2. vbi ait Pontificem non facere de fide ea, quæ antea non erant reuelata, & quorum non erat in re sufficiens motiuum, vt actu fidei crederentur, sed tantum applicare motiuum, quod antea latebat, seu non erat ita sufficienter applicatum,vt prudenter de illius existentia non possemus dubitare: de quo dicam, vbi de authoritate Ecclesiæ,itaque vt credamus actu fidei ea, quæ definiuntur à Pontifice, in tota Ecclesia admisso, sufficit applicari reuelationem diuinam, quæ sit motiuum ad credendum à Pontifice, quem verum Pontificem esse morali certitudine, & prudentissima compertum est, etsi non esset certum certitudine fidei, quia nullibi esset reuelatum talem Pontificem esse legitimè electum. | | **87** Let the conclusion be: in order that what the Pontiff defines may be of the faith and believed by faith, it is not necessary to believe by faith, or for it to be of the faith, that this particular individual Pontiff is the Pontiff. Thus expressly Bellarmine, cited above, and Báñez, who responds to the argument by which it is attempted to prove from his own opinion that those things which are defined by Pontiffs or Councils are not to be believed by faith; and all authors who deny that it is of the faith that this particular individual Pontiff is the true Pontiff, or that this particular individual Council is a true Council—for these men will never admit that those things which have been defined by Trent and by Innocent X are not of the faith, which could not be said without error in the faith. I am moved to this conclusion because the testimony of the Pontiff or of a Council is not the formal reason for believing, but rather the application of the testimony of God, or of a revelation otherwise made by God, which is contained in Scripture or established by tradition. For those things which the Pontiff or Councils define as to be believed by faith were otherwise already revealed, and they then begin to be of the faith—not because they are then revealed for the first time, but because the revelation is sufficiently and efficaciously applied by a certain infallible rule; once this application is made, we are bound to believe the defined object on account of the definition as a condition, and on account of the revelation otherwise made by God as the formal reason. But that which is not the formal reason for believing, but only a condition, ought not to be believed by divine faith. That which is not the formal object of faith, but only a condition, need not necessarily be believed by an act of faith, but it suffices that it be otherwise prudently judged—so runs the common opinion of the Doctors. That the testimony of the Pontiff is not the formal reason for believing by an act of faith is taught by Molina in the first part, question 1, article 2, disputations 1 and 2, where he says that the Pontiff does not make of the faith those things which previously were not revealed and for which there was not in reality a sufficient motive that they be believed by an act of faith, but only applies the motive which previously lay hidden, or was not so sufficiently applied that we could not prudently doubt its existence. Concerning this I shall speak where I treat of the authority of the Church. Therefore, in order that we may believe by an act of faith those things which are defined by a Pontiff admitted throughout the whole Church, it suffices that the divine revelation be applied—which revelation is the motive for believing—by a Pontiff whom it is established with moral certainty and most prudent judgment to be the true Pontiff, even if it were not certain with the certitude of faith, because nowhere would it have been revealed that such a Pontiff was legitimately elected. |
| **88** Contra eamdem conclusionem, sic arguunt iidem authores: si non esset de fide hunc numero Pontificem esse Pontificem, possemus dubitare, an esset verus Pontifex, eo autem ipso,quod possemus dubitare, an sit verus Pontifex, dubitare etiam liceret, an obiecta ab illo definita essent vera, vel an illius definitiones alicuius essent valoris: ergo non teneremur credere obiecta ab ipso definita.Respondeo,hanc esse ineptam consequentiam. Hoc non credimus actu fidei Theologicæ:ergo de illo possumus prudenter dubitare. Etsi enim reuelatio, quæ est fidei obiectum, sit quæ maximè excludit rationem dubitandi,sunt alia plura de quibus non possumus prudenter dubitare, sicuti modo non possum ego dubitare esse Neapolim, etsi nunquam hanc viderim ciuitatem,neque sciam, reuelatum esse, talem dari ciuitatem. Ea autem omnia, quæ prudenter non possunt dubitari, & aliàs credi necesse est ad actum fidei Theologicæ eliciendum, etsi simili actu non credantur, cadunt sub eodem præcepto,sub quo cadit actus fidei Theologicæ, ad quem illorum assensus deseruit. Ratio est,quia virtus percipiens aliquod obiectum percipit indirectè omnia,quæ ad illud necessaria sunt.Hac ratione omnes actus naturales, qui necessario supponuntur ad actum fidei Theologicæ cadunt sub eodem præcepto, quo adstringimur ad formalem actum fidei Theologicæ, etsi illi formaliter Theologici non sint. Sic in hac materia, etiamsi de fide non esset hunc numero hominem non esse Pontificem, quia tamen hoc prudenter à nemine potest dubitari, sed omnes iudicare debent, verum esse Pontificem, & ita iudicare necessarium sit ne illius definitiones actu fidei credendas esse negentur, eodem præcepto, quo tenemur credere actu fidei obiectum à Papa definitum, tanquam fidei articulum tenemur iudicare, illum esse verum Papam, saltem actu naturali, si motiuum supernaturale non subsistit ad id iudicandum fidei actu. | | **88** Against the same conclusion, these same authors argue thus: if it were not a matter of faith that this particular Pontiff is the Pontiff, we could doubt whether he is the true Pontiff; but by the very fact that we could doubt whether he is the true Pontiff, it would also be permissible to doubt whether the objects defined by him were true, or whether his definitions had any value whatsoever: therefore we would not be bound to believe the objects defined by him. I respond that this is an absurd consequence. We do not believe this by an act of Theological faith: therefore we can prudently doubt concerning it. For even though revelation, which is the object of faith, is that which most excludes grounds for doubting, there are many other things concerning which we cannot prudently doubt, just as at this moment I cannot doubt that Naples exists, even though I have never seen this city, nor do I know it to have been revealed that such a city exists. But all those things which cannot prudently be doubted, and which must otherwise be believed in order to elicit an act of Theological faith, even though they are not believed by a similar act, fall under the same precept under which falls the act of Theological faith, to which their assent is subservient. The reason is that a power perceiving some object indirectly perceives all things that are necessary to it. For this reason, all natural acts that are necessarily presupposed for an act of Theological faith fall under the same precept by which we are bound to a formal act of Theological faith, even though they are not formally Theological. Thus in this matter, even though it were not a matter of faith that this particular man is the Pontiff, because nevertheless this cannot be prudently doubted by anyone, but all must judge him to be the true Pontiff, and since so judging is necessary lest one deny that his definitions are to be believed by an act of faith, by the same precept by which we are bound to believe by an act of faith the object defined by the Pope as an article of faith, we are bound to judge that he is the true Pope, at least by a natural act, if a supernatural motive does not subsist for judging this by an act of faith. |
| **89** Obiicit Puente Hurt. disp. 37. sect. 2. testimonium Papæ esse formalem rationem credendi, & Deum medio vero Papa loqui, sicuti loquutus est medio Isaia, & aliis Prophetis, qua ratione non loquitur medio Papa non vero, sed falso existimato, & ita illius definitiones credi non poterunt fide diuina. Respondeo Papam non recipere nouam reuelationem à Deo, dum obiectum fide credendum definit, sed tantum applicare reuelationem præexistentem. Rem hanc latius, & ex professo exagitatam tradam punct. 9. | | **89** Puente Hurt[ado] objects in disputation 37, section 2, that the testimony of the Pope is the formal reason for believing, and that God speaks through the medium of the true Pope, just as He spoke through the medium of Isaiah and the other Prophets; for which reason He does not speak through the medium of a Pope who is not true, but falsely supposed [to be Pope], and thus his definitions cannot be believed with divine faith. I respond that the Pope does not receive a new revelation from God when he defines an object to be believed by faith, but only applies a preexisting revelation. I shall treat this matter more broadly and in a dedicated manner in point 9. |
| **90** His non obstantibus, sto sententiæ affirmanti hunc numero hominem v. g. Innocentium X. esse verum Papam, & hoc numero Concilium v. g. Tridentinum esse obiecta fide diuina credenda. Ratio est, quia etsi hoc necessarium non sit ad credendum fide diuina obiecta definita à Pontifice, seu Concilio, secundum hanc sententiam sincerius defenditur, & clariùs explicatur infallibilitas definitionum, maximè in sententia eorum, qui asserunt Deum loqui medio Papa definiente, sicuti loquutus est mediis aliis Prophetis. Est insuper hæc sententia sanctissimæ sedi gratior, quæ maiorem reuerentiam defert, quam opposita, & aptior ad errores hæreticorum, qui de summa Pontificis dignitate indignè sentiunt, confutandos. | | **90** Notwithstanding these things, I stand by the opinion affirming that this particular man, for example Innocent X, is the true Pope, and that this particular Council, for example the Council of Trent, are objects to be believed with divine faith. The reason is that, although this is not necessary for believing with divine faith the objects defined by the Pontiff or Council, according to this opinion the infallibility of definitions is more sincerely defended and more clearly explained, especially in the opinion of those who assert that God speaks through the medium of the Pope defining, just as He spoke through the medium of the other Prophets. Moreover, this opinion is more pleasing to the most holy See, which it shows greater reverence than does the opposing view, and it is more suitable for refuting the errors of heretics who think unworthily concerning the supreme dignity of the Pontiff. |
| **91** Præterea si de fide non esset hunc numero hominem esse verum Papam, neque esse de fide illius antecessorem talem fuisse, & sic de tota retro serie Pontificum de fide non esset fuisse Papas legitimos, atque ita rueret tota veræ Ecclesiæ certitudo, si enim Pontifices legitimi non fuissent, neque Episcopi, & Sacerdotes essent legitimi. Qua ratione argumentantur hæretici contendentes saltem à tempore Vrbani defecisse legitimam Episcoporum successionem. Insuper nec de fide esset dari veram Ecclesiam, quæ tota ab vno capite dependet, sine quo Concilia nihil valerent. Celebrata enim sub Pontifice ficto, seu non legitimo, legitima non essent. Accedit in Conciliis specialiter in Bulla Martini V. apud Concilium Constantiense disponi primum omnium exigendum esse ab hæreticis, qui Ecclesiæ Catholicæ volunt reconciliari, vt credant Papam canonicè electum, qui pro tempore fuerit, eius nomine expresso esse successorem Petri, & habere supremam potestatem in Ecclesia: ergo hoc ex mente Conciliorum, & præcipuè Martini V. in prædicta Bulla fide credendum est. Deinde concilia non distinguunt inter Pontificem in communi, & hunc numero Pontificem, qui nunc sedet cum totius Ecclesiæ consensione, sed hunc cum eadem veneratione, & fide amplectuntur: sic Chalcedonense Concilium recepit nominatim Leonem Papam II. Synodus Agathonem, Mileuitanum Innoc. III. & sic de cæteris. | | **91** Moreover, if it were not a matter of faith that this particular man is the true Pope, nor a matter of faith that his predecessor was such, and thus concerning the entire past succession of Pontiffs it were not a matter of faith that they were legitimate Popes, then the whole certainty of the true Church would collapse, for if the Pontiffs were not legitimate, neither would the Bishops and Priests be legitimate. By this reasoning heretics argue, contending that at least from the time of Urban the legitimate succession of Bishops failed. Furthermore, it would not be a matter of faith that there exists a true Church, which depends entirely upon one head, without whom Councils would have no validity. For those celebrated under a fictitious, or non-legitimate, Pontiff would not be legitimate. Additionally, in the Councils—especially in the Bull of Martin V at the Council of Constance—it is laid down that the very first thing to be required of heretics who wish to be reconciled to the Catholic Church is that they believe that the Pope canonically elected, whoever he may be at the time, his name being expressly stated, is the successor of Peter and possesses supreme power in the Church: therefore, according to the mind of the Councils, and especially of Martin V in the aforesaid Bull, this must be believed as a matter of faith. Furthermore, the councils do not distinguish between the Pontiff in general and this particular Pontiff who now sits with the consent of the whole Church, but they embrace him with the same veneration and faith: thus the Council of Chalcedon received by name Pope Leo [I], the Second Synod [received] Agatho, the [Council of] Milevis [received] Innocent III, and so on concerning the rest. |
| **92** Censeo insuper, eo ipso quod hic numero Pontifex à tota Ecclesia sit receptus, verum Pontificem esse fidei certitudine credendum esse, antequam aliquid definiat. Ratio est, quia totum motiuum ad hanc veritatem credendam subsistit ante definitionem, ante hanc enim est reuelatio vniuersalis pro omnibus Pontificibus legitimè electis, & est euidentia moralis hunc numero Pontificem à tota Ecclesia receptum esse contentum in vniuersali reuelatione, seu esse vnum ex illis, pro quibus reuelatio facta est, quod sufficit pro fidei actu. | | **92** I hold, moreover, that by the very fact that this particular Pope has been received by the whole Church, it must be believed with the certitude of faith that he is a true Pontiff, even before he defines anything. The reason is that the entire motive for believing this truth subsists prior to any definition, for before this there exists the universal revelation for all Popes legitimately elected, and there is moral evidence that this particular Pope, having been received by the whole Church, is contained in the universal revelation, or is one of those for whom the revelation was made, which suffices for an act of faith. |
| Ad intelligentiam huius doctrinæ distinguere oportet duo, quæ ferè omnes confundunt; videlicet aliud esse hunc hominem esse legitimè ad Pontificatum electum, aliud esse verum Pontificem. Primum dicit esse capacem electionis passiuæ, & esse electum ab his, penes quos est eligendi authoritas cum omnibus requisitis ad electionem. Secundum est habere authoritatem Pontificiam datam à Deo, electione supposita, & specialem Spiritus sancti assistentiam. Ex his igitur primum est moraliter euidens propter Ecclesiæ testimonium, non tamen est reuelatum, nec fide diuina credi necesse est, sed postquam creditur propter moralem euidentiam ex consensu totius Ecclesiæ, & speciali assistentia Dei erga suam Ecclesiam postea creditur assensu fidei illum esse verum Papam, quia reuelatum est omnem legitimè electum esse verum Papam. Vnde prior assensus explicat subiectum reuelationis vniuersalis, & ostendit hunc hominem in tali subiecto contineri; sicuti quando credo Petrum contraxisse originale, quia reuelatum est, omnem descendentem ex Adamo illud contrahere, non credo fide diuina Petrum esse hominem, & ex Adamo descendentem, sed id supponitur iam præiudicatum ad fidei assensum, vt ex Puent. Hurt. sententia dicebam. Sic cum credo Innoc. X. legitimè electum esse verum Papam; ad hunc actum credendi supponitur præiudicatum illum esse legitimè electum, & de illo legitimè electo, tanquam de subiecto euidentia morali cognito, per actum fidei enuncio esse verum Papam. Teneor etiam præcepto fidei ad actum, quo iudico esse legitimè electum, & si hic actus fidei non sit, quia hoc obiectum est euidenter credibile, & morali euidentia certum, & aliàs talis actus requiritur ad assensum fidei. Fides enim, sicuti quælibet alia virtus, non solum obligat ad suos proprios actus, sed ad omnes, qui ad illos prærequiruntur. | | To understand this doctrine, it is necessary to distinguish two things which almost everyone confounds; namely, that it is one thing for this man to be legitimately elected to the Pontificate, and another thing to be the true Pontiff. The first signifies being capable of passive election, and being elected by those in whose hands lies the authority to elect, with all the requisites for the election. The second is to possess the Pontifical authority given by God, the election being presupposed, and the special assistance of the Holy Spirit. From these considerations, therefore, the first is morally evident by reason of the testimony of the Church, yet it is not revealed, nor is it necessary to believe it by divine faith; but after it is believed on account of the moral evidence arising from the consent of the whole Church and the special assistance of God toward His Church, it is then believed by an assent of faith that he is the true Pope, because it has been revealed that everyone legitimately elected is the true Pope. Whence the prior assent explicates the subject of the universal revelation, and shows that this man is contained in such a subject; just as when I believe that Peter contracted original sin, because it has been revealed that everyone descending from Adam contracts it, I do not believe by divine faith that Peter is a man and descended from Adam, but this is presupposed as already prejudged for the assent of faith, as I was saying following the opinion of Hurtado de Mendoza. Thus when I believe that Innocent X, legitimately elected, is the true Pope; for this act of believing it is presupposed as prejudged that he is legitimately elected, and concerning that legitimately elected person, as concerning a subject known by moral evidence, through an act of faith I declare him to be the true Pope. I am also bound by the precept of faith to the act by which I judge him to be legitimately elected, and if this is not an act of faith, it is because this object is evidently credible and certain by moral evidence, and otherwise such an act is required for the assent of faith. For faith, just as any other virtue, obliges not only to its own proper acts, but to all those acts which are prerequisite to them. |
| **94** Addò insuper definitionem à Pontifice latam posse conducere, vt actu fidei credam, hunc hominem definientem pro tota Ecclesia esse verum Pontificem, quia per huiusmodi definitionem nouum fundamentum habeo, vt mihi persuadeam, illum esse contentum in eorum numero, pro quibus vniuersalis reuelatio facta est, quia de diuina prouidentia credi non potest permissuram falsum Pontificem totius Ecclesiæ consensione definire aliquid pro tota Ecclesia. Vnde eo ipso quod videam Pontificem aliquid definire antequam actu fidei definitionem credam, habeo ex ipsa definitione applicationem quandam moraliter certam, & simul cum aliis fundamentis moraliter euidentem reuelationis vniuersalis factæ pro omnibus legitimè electis ad hunc hominem, qua posita applicatione, tanquam conditione credo actu fidei illum esse legitimum Pontificem propter Ecclesiæ reuelationem, & postea credo ipsum obiectum definitum fidei actu, aut discursu Theologico secundum definitionis qualitatem. | | **94** I add, moreover, that a definition handed down by the Pontiff can serve to enable me to believe by an act of faith that this man defining for the whole Church is the true Pontiff, because through such a definition I have a new foundation upon which to persuade myself that he is included in the number of those for whom the universal revelation has been made, since it cannot be believed of divine providence that it would permit a false Pontiff to define anything for the whole Church with the consent of the universal Church. Whence by the very fact that I see the Pontiff defining something—before I believe the definition by an act of faith—I have from the definition itself a certain application that is morally certain, and together with other foundations morally evident, of the universal revelation made for all legitimately elected [Pontiffs] to this man; this application having been posited as a condition, I believe by an act of faith that he is the legitimate Pontiff on account of the Church's revelation, and afterwards I believe the very object defined by an act of faith, or by theological reasoning according to the quality of the definition. |
| **95** Ex hac doctrina facilè respondetur Puente Hurt. ad afferenti definitionem non conducere ad credendum hunc numero Papam esse verum Papam, quia qui dubitat de legitimatione Pontificis, poterit etiam dubitare de legitimatione definitionis ab ipso latæ, & prius est fateri hunc Pontificem esse legitimum, & postea illius definitioni tanquam certæ, & infallibili assentire. Mitto definitionem innitentem reuelationi præhabitæ, à Pontifice propositæ legitimam fore, etiamsi Pontifex tantum esset inuincibiliter talis existimatus, & non verus Papa. Respondeo igitur definitionem ipsam antequam legitima censeatur eo ipso, quod feratur fundamentum præbere ad credendum hunc numero Pontificem esse legitimum, quo credito postea illius definitioni, tanquam legitimæ credendum est. Vnde posset contingere, vt si quis non haberet fundamentum sufficiens ad credendum hunc hominem esse verum Papam, quia vniuersalis reuelatio illi non erat sufficienter applicata pro hoc homine, postquam videret ipsum aliquid definire pro tota Ecclesia cum illius consensu sufficiens fundamentum haberet ad credendum Pontificem definientem esse verum Papam, & sufficientem applicationem reuelationis vniuersalis pro hoc Pontifice, qua posita applicatione posset, & teneretur credere esse verum Papam. | | **95** From this doctrine one easily responds to Puente Hurtado, who asserts that a definition does not serve to make one believe that this particular Pope is the true Pope, because he who doubts the legitimacy of the Pontiff will also be able to doubt the legitimacy of the definition issued by him, and it is necessary first to acknowledge that this Pontiff is legitimate, and afterwards to assent to his definition as certain and infallible. I set aside [the fact] that a definition resting on a prior revelation and proposed by the Pontiff would be legitimate, even if the Pontiff were only invincibly considered to be such, and not the true Pope. I respond, therefore, that the definition itself, before it is considered legitimate by the very fact that it is issued, provides a foundation for believing that this particular Pontiff is legitimate; and once this is believed, one must afterwards believe in his definition as legitimate. Whence it could happen that if someone did not have sufficient foundation for believing that this man is the true Pope, because the universal revelation was not sufficiently applied to him in regard to this man, after he saw him define something for the whole Church with its consent, he would have sufficient foundation for believing that the Pontiff making the definition is the true Pope, and [would have] sufficient application of the universal revelation in regard to this Pontiff; and once this application is established, he could and would be bound to believe [him to be] the true Pope. |
| **96** Insuper de fide est Ecclesiam constare membris, quæ verè sint membra Ecclesiæ, cum enim sit de fide dari vnam veram Ecclesiam, de fide esse debet, dari vera membra illius in quocumque consistat ratio membri: ergo de fide etiam est Ecclesiam constare vero capite, non enim minus indiuiduatur, & componitur Ecclesia ex capite, quam ex membris, & semper per ordinem ad vnum caput etiam summa sede vacante, intelligitur: ergo cum illi omnium fidelium consensu aliquod caput præficitur, fide tenendum est illud esse verum caput. Idem quod de hoc numero Pontifice diximus, de hoc numero Concilio intelligendum est. Eadem enim ratione de vtroque Doctores sentiunt. | | **96** Moreover, it is a matter of faith that the Church consists of members which truly are members of the Church, for since it is of faith that there exists one true Church, it must be of faith that there exist true members of that Church in whatsoever the nature of membership consists: therefore it is also of faith that the Church consists of a true head, for the Church is no less individuated and composed from its head than from its members, and is always understood by reference to one head even when the supreme see is vacant: therefore when, by the consensus of all the faithful, some head is placed over it, it must be held by faith that this is the true head. The same thing which we have said concerning this particular Pope must be understood concerning this particular Council. For the Doctors hold the same view concerning both for the same reason. |
| **97** Obiicies: etiamsi reuelatum sit omnem legitimè electum esse verum Papam, non constat hunc hominem, qui modo Ecclesiæ præest, esse legitimè electum, quia de hoc in particulari nulla est reuelatio, nec nobis euidens est illum esse capacem dignitatis Pontificiæ, quia non constat, an sit ritè baptizatus, nec constare potest de intentione baptizantis. Similiter non constat Patres Concilij esse Episcopos legitimos ritè baptizatos, & ordinatos: ergo non potest constare fidei certitudine Concilium ab ipsis celebratum esse legitimum. | | **97** You will object: even if it has been revealed that everyone legitimately elected is a true Pope, it is not established that this man, who now presides over the Church, has been legitimately elected, because concerning this in particular there is no revelation, nor is it evident to us that he is capable of the pontifical dignity, because it is not established whether he was ritually baptized, nor can there be certainty concerning the intention of the one baptizing. Similarly it is not established that the Fathers of the Council are legitimate Bishops ritually baptized and ordained: therefore it cannot be established with the certitude of faith that the Council celebrated by them is legitimate. |
| **98** Respondeo reuelatum esse hunc numero Pontificem à tota Ecclesia receptum esse legitimum Pontificem non aliqua singulari reuelatione pro illo singulariter tradita, sed reuelatione vniuersali facta pro omnibus constat certitudine, & euidentia morali ex eo, quod à tota Ecclesia pacificè sit receptus. Ex hoc fit moraliter euidens ipsum esse baptizatum, & ex omni parte capacem dignitatis Pontificiæ, & legitimè electum, & consequenter ipsum comprehendi reuelatione vniuersali, ob quam credimus fide diuina ipsum esse verum Papam. Etsi enim forsan non repugnet eligi in Pontificem hominem aliàs incapacem, repugnat hunc pacificè à tota Ecclesia recipi: ex ordinaria enim, & speciali prouidentia Dei credendum impediendam esse electionem personæ incapacis ad Pontificiam dignitatem, & dato quod incapax eligeretur, credendum est defectum manifestandum esse, antequam ab vniuersali Ecclesia pacificè recipiatur. Si enim propter specialem assistentiam Spiritus sancti repugnat verum Pontificem rem falsam definire, multò melius ex eodem capite repugnabit totam Ecclesiam illegitimum Pontificem,tanquam verum agnofcere. Quod refertur de Ioanne VIII. videlicet fuiffe fœminam, fabula eft, & hæreticorum commentum. Legatur Palao tom. 1. tract. 4. difp. 1. punct. 5. §. 2. n. 7. vbi id folidè probat ex infigni teftimonio Leonis IX. Addendum eft impedimenta iure humano introducta ad dignitatem Pontificiam ab Ecclefia auferri, feu difpenfari fi quæ funt in eo,qui ad fummum Pontificatum affumitur electione, feu eo ipfo quod eligatur. In re enim tanti momenti Ecclefiæ animus eft eam celebrare meliori modo,quo poteft,vt communi bono, & Ecclefiæ confulatur. | | **98** I respond that it has been revealed that this Pontiff, having been received by the entire Church in this number, is a legitimate Pontiff—not by any singular revelation specially given for him individually, but by universal revelation made for all. This is established with moral certitude and evidence from the fact that he has been peacefully received by the entire Church. From this it becomes morally evident that he is baptized, and in every respect capable of the pontifical dignity, and legitimately elected, and consequently that he is comprehended by the universal revelation on account of which we believe with divine faith that he is the true Pope. For although perhaps it may not be contradictory for a man otherwise incapable to be elected Pontiff, it is contradictory for such a one to be peacefully received by the entire Church: for from the ordinary and special providence of God it must be believed that the election of a person incapable of the pontifical dignity would be impeded, and granted that an incapable person were elected, it must be believed that the defect would be manifested before he is peacefully received by the universal Church. For if, on account of the special assistance of the Holy Spirit, it is contradictory for a true Pontiff to define something false, much better from the same principle will it be contradictory for the entire Church to acknowledge an illegitimate Pontiff as true. What is reported concerning John VIII—namely, that she was a woman—is a fable and a fiction of heretics. Let one read Palao [Translator's note: likely Francisco Palao], tome 1, tract 4, disputation 1, point 5, §2, n. 7, where he solidly proves this from the distinguished testimony of Leo IX. It must be added that impediments introduced by human law to the pontifical dignity are removed, or dispensed by the Church if any such exist in him who is assumed to the supreme Pontificate by election, or by the very fact that he is elected. For in a matter of such great moment, it is the intention of the Church to celebrate it in the best way possible, so that the common good and the Church may be provided for. |
| **99** Obiicies 2. Ecclefia errauit matrimonia eunuchorum legitima effe putans, donec hoc errore purgata fuit per Sixtum V. definitione præftita fuper hac re: ergo eodem modo poterit errare exiftimans hunc numero Pontificem effe legitimum:ergo communis Ecclefiæ confenfus non facit moraliter euidens hunc numero Pontificem contineri in vniuerfali reuelatione. Refpondeo Ecclefiam nunquam pofituè declaraffe matrimonia eunuchorum effe legitima, fed tamen ea omiffa illa permififfe, in quo nullus fuit error: poftea vero cum ad examen quæftio hæc fuit vocata veritatem Ecclefia deprehendit. In Pontifice autem Ecclefia pofituè fe habet, & illum verum effe Pontificem ipfa electione, & communi omnium fidelium receptione teftatur. | | **99** You will object secondly: The Church erred in thinking that the marriages of eunuchs were legitimate, until she was purged of this error by Sixtus V through a definitive pronouncement made on this matter: therefore in the same manner she could err in judging that this particular Pope is legitimate: therefore the common consensus of the Church does not make it morally evident that this particular Pope is contained in the universal revelation. I respond: The Church never positively declared that the marriages of eunuchs were legitimate, but rather by passing over them in silence she permitted them, in which there was no error: afterwards, however, when this question was called to formal examination, the Church discerned the truth. But in regard to the Pope, the Church conducts herself positively, and by the very election and by the common reception of all the faithful she testifies that he is the true Pope. |
| **100** Obiicies 3. legitimus Pontifex poteft in hærefim etiam externam incidere, non tamen publicam, fed apud vnum, vel alterum manifeftatam, quo crimine commiffo cadet à fua dignitate, & non erit verus Pontifex; nihilominus talis communiter à tota Ecclefia exiftimabitur eadem ratione, ac antequam in hærefim incideret: ergo tota Ecclefia poteft errare cultum veri Pontificis deferendo homini, qui in re verus Pontifex non fit:ergo illius teftimonium non eft fufficiens applicatio reuelationis vniuerfalis, vt ex vi illius actu fidei credamus, hunc numero hominem effe verum Pontificem. Deinde cum certo nobis non poffit conftare Pontificem à fide non defeciffe, fidei certitudine non poteft nobis effe notum illum effe legitimum Pontificem. Refpondeo verum effe Pontificem poffe in hærefim incidere, vt cum communi fententia tenent Bannez, Caiet. Driedo, Canus, Sotus, Corduba, Aragon, & Valentia apud Palao fupra, qui graues refert hiftorias, ex quibus conftat lapfos effe in hærefim Victorem V. Marcellinum, Liberium, Honorium, & Anaftafium II. Nihilominus fic in hærefim lapfum non cadere à fua dignitate,fed eam retinere,efféque verum Pontificem, quoufque ab Ecclefia declaretur crimen hærefis ab eo commiffum. Ita Bann. Caiet. Sotus, Canus, Corduba, & Valentia apud eundem Palao, quos ipfe ibidem fequitur. | | **100** You will object thirdly: a legitimate Pontiff can fall into heresy, even external heresy, though not public heresy, but heresy manifested to one or another person; by committing this crime he would fall from his dignity and would not be a true Pontiff. Nevertheless, such a one would commonly be regarded by the whole Church in the same way as before he fell into heresy. Therefore, the whole Church can err by rendering the worship due to a true Pontiff to a man who is not in fact a true Pontiff. Therefore, its testimony is not a sufficient application of universal revelation, so that by virtue of it we might believe by an act of faith that this particular man is the true Pontiff. Furthermore, since it cannot be certainly known to us that the Pontiff has not defected from the faith, it cannot be known to us with the certitude of faith that he is the legitimate Pontiff. I respond that it is true that the Pontiff can fall into heresy, as Báñez, Cajetan, Driedo, Cano, Soto, Córdoba, Aragon, and Valentia hold according to the common opinion, cited by Palao above, who reports weighty historical accounts from which it is established that Victor V, Marcellinus, Liberius, Honorius, and Anastasius II fell into heresy. Nevertheless, one who has thus fallen into heresy does not fall from his dignity, but retains it and remains the true Pontiff until the crime of heresy committed by him is declared by the Church. So hold Báñez, Cajetan, Soto, Cano, Córdoba, and Valentia, cited by the same Palao, whom he himself follows in that place. |
| **101** Obiicies 4. Accidit aliquando in Ecclefia effe exiftimatos veros Pontifices, qui tales non erant: ergo Ecclefia poteft errare in vero Pontifice proponendo. Nec fide certum eft legitimum effe Pontificem eum, qui ab Ecclefia vniuerfim talis cenfetur. Refpondeo omnia fchifmata frequenter nafci priufquam ab vniuerfa Ecclefia Pontifex, vt talis fit receptus, neque vnquam poftquam tota Ecclefia ad Pontificiam dignitatem electum, vt verum Pontificem admifit, & Chriftiani Principes, & vniuerfum Catholicorum refpublicæ abfque vlla hæfitatione obedientiam alicui, vt vero Pontifici detulere fubortam fuiffe prudentem dubitandi rationem circa illius legitimam dignitatem. | | **101** You will object 4. It has sometimes happened in the Church that certain men were considered true Pontiffs who were not such: therefore the Church can err in proposing who is the true Pontiff. Nor is it certain by faith that he whom the Church universally regards as such is the legitimate Pontiff. I respond that all schisms frequently arise before the Pontiff has been received as such by the universal Church, and never after the entire Church has admitted a man elected to the pontifical dignity as the true Pontiff, and Christian Princes and the entire commonwealth of Catholics have without any hesitation rendered obedience to someone as the true Pontiff, has there arisen a prudent reason for doubting concerning his legitimate dignity. |
| **101** Ex hac doctrina infero, ad credendum ea infallibilitate, qua credi debent definita à concilio legitimo, hoc concilium legitimum effe fufficere præco-gnofci certitudine naturali moraliter certa, & eui-denti concilium effe legitimum, & poftea hoc ip-fum à concilio definiri, quia fuppofito tanquam conditione iudicio moraliter certo, & euidenti circa concilij legitimationem poftea omnia reuelata à concilio poffunt credi eo certitudinis gradu, fub quo funt definita. Cum autem vnum ex definitis fit ipfa legitimatio concilij, hæc credenda eft authori-tate concilij interueniente, ficut & cætera alia ab eodem concilio definita. | | **101** From this doctrine I infer that, in order to believe with that infallibility with which things defined by a legitimate council ought to be believed, it suffices for this council to be legitimate that it be known beforehand with natural certitude that is morally certain and evident that the council is legitimate, and afterwards that this very fact be defined by the council itself, because—supposing as a condition a judgment that is morally certain and evident concerning the legitimation of the council—afterwards all things revealed by the council can be believed with that degree of certitude under which they are defined. Moreover, since one of the things defined is the very legitimation of the council, this must be believed by the intervening authority of the council, just as the other things defined by the same council. |
| **103** Obiicies 5. Non poteft effe euidens moraliter omnes Epifcopos, quibus conftat hoc numero con-cilium, effe baptizatos, non effe hæreticos, aliaque huiufmodi requifita, vt fint legitimi miniftri con-cilij: ergo non poteft effe fufficiens applicatio reue-lationis vniuerfalis, refpectu huius numero concilij, vt actu fidei legitimum effe credatur. Refpondeo effe moraliter certum, & euidens maiorem partem Pa-trum concilij effe legitimos illius miniftros, effe ba-ptizatos, validè ordinatos, & habere omnia requifi-ta, vt validè concilio affiftant. Eft enim moraliter impoffibile in terris Catholicorum, vbi religio vi-get, maiorem partem Epifcoporum non effe legiti-mos, aut aliquo impedimento dirimente laborare, vt fint legitimi confiliarij, quod omnibus fit occul-tum: repugnat enim moraliter falfam religionem animo incidentem exterius non erumpere, & ex malis fructibus, quos femper malæ arbores faciunt, has non agnofci. Mitto Bellarm. tom. 1. lib. 2. de concil. authorit. dixiffe ad authoritatem concilij fufficere eos conuenire, qui externè regunt Eccle-fiam, quamuis non fint baptizati, aut fint hæretici. Neque hanc fententiam improbo ex eo quod durum videatur velle Deum fuam Ecclefiam regere flagitio-fis miniftris, quia hæc ratio mihi efficaciter fuadet nunquam Deum permiffurum hæreticos, aut non baptizatos concilio Catholicorum his vitiis occul-tis adfuturum. Quod autem cafu quo id permitte-ret concilium effet validum magis extollit quam deprimit Dei prouidentiam erga fuam Ecclefiam, quia melius huic effet concilium ab hæreticis cele-bratum, validum effe, cum tunc ad Dei prouidenti-am pertineret prohibere, ne falfum aliquod dogma in concilio definiretur, & per flagitiofos miniftros veram doctrinam fuam docere Ecclefiam, iuxta illud *Matth. 29. Super cathedram Moyfis federunt fcribæ: omnia ergo quæcumque dixerint vobis facite, &c.* quam in ea celebrari aliquod inualidum concilium abfque affiftentia Spiritus fancti, quod communiter in tota Ecclefia verum, & legitimum cenferetar. | | **103** You will object 5. It cannot be morally evident that all the Bishops who constitute a council of this number are baptized, are not heretics, and possess the other requisites of this kind necessary for them to be legitimate ministers of the council: therefore there cannot be a sufficient application of the universal revelation with respect to this particular council, such that it may be believed by an act of faith to be legitimate. I respond that it is morally certain and evident that the greater part of the Fathers of the council are legitimate ministers thereof, are baptized, validly ordained, and possess all the requisites so as validly to take part in the council. For it is morally impossible in the lands of Catholics, where religion flourishes, that the greater part of the Bishops should not be legitimate, or should labor under some diriment impediment preventing them from being legitimate councilors, in such a way that this would be hidden from all: for it is morally repugnant that a false religion striking the mind should not break forth externally, and that from the evil fruits which evil trees always produce, these should not be recognized. I pass over the fact that Bellarmine [Robert Bellarmine] in tome 1, book 2, *De Conciliorum Authoritate*, said that for the authority of a council it suffices that those convene who externally govern the Church, even though they be not baptized or be heretics. Nor do I disapprove this opinion on the ground that it seems harsh to wish that God should govern His Church through wicked ministers, because this reasoning efficaciously persuades me that God will never permit heretics or the unbaptized to be present at a council of Catholics with these vices concealed. But that, in the case where He should permit it, the council would be valid, exalts rather than diminishes God's providence toward His Church, because it would be better for the Church that a council celebrated by heretics be valid, since then it would pertain to God's providence to prevent any false dogma from being defined in the council, and through wicked ministers to teach His Church true doctrine, according to that passage in *Matthew 23:* "The scribes have sat upon the chair of Moses: all things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do, etc.," than that some invalid council should be celebrated in it without the assistance of the Holy Spirit, which would commonly be judged throughout the whole Church to be true and legitimate. |
| **104** Hæc dixerim non animo rem definiendi, non enim ad noftram quæftionem neceffarium eft, fufficiet enim afferere, implicare moraliter maiorem Patrum par-tem, qui concilio affiftunt, non effe illius miniftros legitimos feu effe hæreticos, aut non baptizatos. Hæreticos, quorum crimen ab Ecclefia declaratum non eft, fore legitimos concilij miniftros cafu, quo illi affifterent, poteft fuaderi, quia Epifcopus, qui in hærefim labitur, non cadit à fua dignitate, neque iurifdictione Epifcopali cadit quoufque ab Ecclefia eâ priuetur, vel faltem illius declaretur crimen vt de fummo Pontifice paulo antea dicebamus. Non ba-ptizatos fore legitimos concilij miniftros difficilius eft, quia hi non pertinent ad Ecclefiam, nec funt verè Epifcopi, fed fictè, & apparenter: ideo credo hos effe illegitimos miniftros, & certius eft mihi, neque hos, neque hæreticos vnquam Deum permif-furum intereffe concilio, quod Catholicorum Ec-clefia legitimum effe inuincibiliter iudicat, præcipuè in eo numero, vt propter illorum illegitimationem concilium poffit illegitimum euadere. | | **104** I have said these things not with the intention of defining the matter, for it is not necessary for our question; it will suffice to assert that it morally involves the greater part of the Fathers who assist at the council not being its legitimate ministers or being heretics, or not being baptized. That heretics, whose crime has not been declared by the Church, would be legitimate ministers of the council in the case that they should assist, can be argued, because a Bishop who falls into heresy does not fall from his dignity, nor does he fall from episcopal jurisdiction as long as he is deprived of it by the Church, or at least his crime is declared, as we were saying a little earlier concerning the Supreme Pontiff. That the unbaptized would be legitimate ministers of the council is more difficult, because these do not belong to the Church, nor are they truly Bishops, but fictitiously and apparently: therefore I believe these to be illegitimate ministers, and it is more certain to me that God will never permit either these or heretics to be present at a council which the Church of Catholics invincibly judges to be legitimate, especially in such a number that on account of their illegitimacy the council could turn out to be illegitimate. |
| **105** Obiicies 6. non eft de fide Chriftum effe fub fpeciebus huius numero hoftiæ quod docent Soarius tom.3. in 3. partem difp.65. fect. 2. & Vafquez 1. 2. difp.201. num. 49. qui grauiter reprehendit Caiet. oppofitum afferentem, neque hunc infantem, quem baptizari vidimus effe in gratia, aut hanc recipi ab hoc homine accedente ad facramentum pœnitentiæ, etfi fint vniuerfales reuelationes, quibus reuelatum eft, Chriftum effe fub fpeciebus cuiufcunque hoftiæ ritè, & rectè confecratæ, & omnem accedentem cum debita difpofitione ad facramentum gratiam recipere: ergo ficut hæ reuelationes vniuerfales non poffunt applicari his indiuiduis affignatis, vt ea actu fidei credantur, ita nec vniuerfalis reuelatio qua traditur omnes legitimè electos ad fummum Pontificatum verè effe Petri fucceffores, & veros Papas poteft applicari huic numero Pontifici ab Ecclefia recepto. | | **105** You will object 6. It is not a matter of faith that Christ is present under the species of this particular host—a teaching advanced by Suárez, tome 3, *In Tertiam Partem*, disputation 65, section 2, and by Vásquez, *Prima Secundae*, disputation 201, number 49, who gravely censures Cajetan for asserting the opposite—nor that this infant whom we see baptized is in grace, nor that grace is received by this man approaching the sacrament of penance, even though there are universal revelations by which it has been revealed that Christ is under the species of any host rightly and properly consecrated, and that everyone approaching with due disposition to the sacrament receives grace: therefore, just as these universal revelations cannot be applied to these designated individuals so that they may be believed by an act of faith, so neither can the universal revelation by which it is handed down that all legitimately elected to the Supreme Pontificate are truly successors of Peter and true Popes be applied to this particular Pontiff accepted by the Church. |
| **106** Refpondeo, difparem effe rationem, quia non eft moraliter euidens eo gradu, quo euidentia credibilitatis requiritur ad actum fidei hanc hoftiam ritè effe confecratam à legitimo miniftro, non enim eft teftimonium vniuerfalis Ecclefiæ, quod hoc fuadeat, ficut eft ad fuadendum hunc numero Pontificem effe legitimè electum. Idem potiori iure dicito de hoc homine accedente ad facramentum pœnitentiæ, cum nec ipfi poffit euidenter conftare accedere cum difpofitione requifita. Similiter nemini poteft euidenter conftare euidentià fupradictâ baptizantem infantem habere intentionem illum baptizandi. Excipe tamen eum, qui baptizat infantem, in quo nulla requiritur difpofitio ad gratiam baptifmi recipiendam, talis enim baptizans poteft euidenter cognofcere fe habere intentionem baptizandi puerum, & cum nulla fpecialis qualitas requiratur ex parte miniftri baptizantis, nec difpofitio ex parte infantis baptizati; ille, qui euidenter cognofcit fe ex intentione baptizaffe puerum, habet fufficientem applicationem reuelationis vniuerfalis, qua reuelatum eft, omnem legitimè baptizatum gratiam recipere, refpectu huius pueri, ac proinde hic poteft fide diuina credere puerum illum gratiam recepiffe, ac in illa permanere per totum tempus, quod rationis vfum præcedat, in quo nullus gratiam amittit, quia hæc non nifi per peccatum liberè commiffum deperditur. Ita fentit Tannerus q.1.dub.3. n.71. | | **106** I respond that the reasoning is different, because it is not morally evident to that degree by which the evidence of credibility is required for an act of faith that this host has been duly consecrated by a legitimate minister; for there is no testimony of the universal Church which would persuade this, as there is to persuade that this particular Pontiff has been legitimately elected. Say the same, with even greater right, concerning this man approaching the sacrament of penance, since neither can it be evidently established to him that he approaches with the required disposition. Similarly, it cannot be evidently established to anyone with the aforementioned evidence that one baptizing an infant has the intention of baptizing him. Except, however, the one who baptizes an infant, in whom no disposition is required for receiving the grace of baptism; for such a one baptizing can evidently know that he has the intention of baptizing the child, and since no special quality is required on the part of the minister baptizing, nor any disposition on the part of the infant being baptized, he who evidently knows that he has baptized a child with the intention [of doing so] has sufficient application of the universal revelation by which it has been revealed that every one legitimately baptized receives grace, with respect to this child, and therefore he can believe with divine faith that that child has received grace and remains in it throughout the entire time that precedes the use of reason, in which no one loses grace, because this is not lost except through sin freely committed. So holds Tanner, q.1, dub.3, n.71. |
