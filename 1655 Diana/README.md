## RESOLUTION VI.

*To confirm those things which have been adduced above in favor of our position, the following question is proposed: Whether it is altogether a matter of faith that, for example, this particular Innocent X is the true Pontiff and the true successor of Peter.*

[...] it is not a matter of faith that this Pontiff is the true Pontiff; therefore his determinations will never be matters of faith. The antecedent is proved because it is not a matter of faith, nor is it otherwise established with complete certainty, that he is truly baptized, and consequently neither whether he is capable of Episcopal dignity. [...]

[...] even if it is true and certain as a matter of faith that the true Vicar of Christ and successor of Peter cannot err in matters of faith to be proposed, yet it does not seem to be certain as a matter of faith that this particular one cannot err, because it does not seem to be certain as a matter of faith that he is the true Pontiff.

But responding directly to the question at hand: The first opinion asserts that it is not a matter of faith that Innocent—for example, the Tenth—who is truly and felicitously reigning is the true Pontiff [...] because it is not a matter of faith that one now elected to the Pontificate is baptized. Therefore neither that he is the true Pontiff. Secondly, he can define matters of faith and govern the universal Church without being the true Pontiff; for it suffices if he is esteemed and reputed as such; for if the Republic confers jurisdiction upon an incapable Praetor, when he is esteemed as legitimate, lest grave inconveniences follow from null acts. **Therefore we shall say the same regarding an incapable Pontiff who is reputed as legitimate—that Christ confers upon him all jurisdiction and authority, just as if he were truly Pontiff.**

But **I adhere to the affirmative opinion**, for which I presuppose that the Supreme Pontiff can be considered, when he is elected and acknowledged illegitimately, or with suspicion of illegitimacy: in this sense there is no question, because **while there exists a probable foundation regarding the illegitimacy of a Pontiff, one cannot believe with Divine faith that he is the successor of Peter, since divine faith cannot be exercised when there is room for prudent hesitation** [...] but a probable foundation gives occasion for prudent hesitation. **Therefore the Church does not rest until, having removed every foundation for doubt, the occasions for schisms are eliminated.**

In another way a Pontiff is considered **when he is elected and acknowledged so legitimately that the entire Church receives him**, as now our Lord Innocent X, without any trace of controversy, holds the helm of the Christian Republic and the keys of Peter: therefore the question is whether it should be believed with Divine Faith that Innocent X and other Pontiffs peacefully received are legitimate successors of Peter; And as I said, **I think it should be believed with divine faith that each and every such Pontiff is a legitimate successor of Peter.**

[...] And Clement VIII gave great strength to this opinion, who [...] imprisoned certain Doctors who then held the opposite view, and ordered them to go to Rome to give an account of that opinion.

This opinion is proved first, because **in the Bull of Martin V at the Council of Constance it is established that heretics returning to the Church should believe that the Pope canonically elected, whoever he may be at the time (his name being expressed), is the successor of Peter**[...] Second, because many Councils have specifically acknowledged as such the one who was then presiding; but there is no greater reason for one than for another. Third, because **if it is not established as a matter of faith that Pius IV was a true Pope, neither will it be established that the Council of Trent is valid**, because a Council receives all its force from the Pope. But this is almost heretical.

And finally, because otherwise whatever [we hold] concerning the Judge of controversies in the Church, as something certain to be believed by faith, would be plainly ridiculous; for **how ought I to believe as a matter of faith that such a Judge is given, if I cannot state from faith who that person is?** [...] anyone could say, "faith only teaches me that I am bound to approach the Judge of controversies; but it does not tell me that he is Giovanni Battista Pamphilj, or Innocent X. Therefore I am not bound by faith to approach him, or to believe his decisions."

[...] To this argument, Báñez responds [...] that it is not required, in order for some conclusion of faith to be inferred, that both premises be matters of faith [...] but it suffices that one be of faith and the other morally certain [...]

But this solution is precluded by the easiest of arguments, drawn from the inconvenient consequence: **for if it were true, it would follow that this proposition would be a matter of faith: "Under this particular Host is the consecrated Body of Christ,"** because it is truly inferred by evident consequence from one matter of faith [...] and is moreover inferred as from a condition, and as applied from another proposition that is morally certain, namely "this Host is duly consecrated"; therefore, would the conclusion "under this Host is the Body of Christ" be a proposition of faith? [...] **which it is established among all are not matters of faith, since there can underlie them something false due to a defect of intention on the part of the one baptizing, ordaining, or consecrating.**

[...] The sacred Councils favor this view; for the Sixth Synod specifically acknowledges Agatho, confessing him to be the true Pontiff; the Council of Chalcedon acknowledges Leo; the Council of Milevis acknowledges Innocent III [...]

## RESOLUTION VII.

TO the argument that neither from Scripture, nor from tradition, nor from definition can it be established that this one is the legitimate Pontiff; therefore it is not a matter of faith that he is such.

And to that argument [...] that **it is not a matter of faith that this man is baptized: for it is not established regarding the will of the one baptizing, nor is it a matter of faith that he is legitimately a priest**, because it is not established by faith regarding the will of the one conferring or receiving orders; therefore it cannot be established by faith that he is Pontiff.

The response is given by denying the antecedent; for **it is established that this one is the legitimate Pontiff from those testimonies of Scripture by which Peter's primacy is customarily confirmed**; because that is a universal promise, by which all legitimate successors of Peter are immediately contained [...] **and who were to be known by us through moral evidence arising from their legitimate election and peaceful acceptance.**

[...] **"all successors of Peter in the Roman See are Vicars of Christ and true Supreme Pontiffs." For from this induction it follows that both this man and that particular man who has been elected, received, and assumed as Supreme Pontiff by the Catholic Church (such today is Innocent X) is truly the Supreme Pontiff.**

In response to the argument of Báñez, I reply that although that proposition: "this man, who is called Innocent X, is a man of the male sex, or is baptized," considered in itself, is not certain, **yet insofar as it rests upon divine revelation absolutely, it is certain; so that according to this consideration it neither can be, nor could have been false.** [...] **For because we believe by Catholic faith that he whom the Church receives and holds as Supreme Pontiff (who now is none other than Innocent X) is the true Vicar of Christ and legitimate Supreme Pontiff; it follows by necessary consequence that he is male, that he is baptized, and that he has all that without which pontifical power cannot subsist.**

**For it belongs to Divine Providence, which neither wills nor is able to deceive the Church, that Christ's Vicar, whom He wills to be set over His flock, should lack nothing which the power he bears and the office he must execute necessarily requires.**

Therefore, **it must be said that it pertains to the special providence of God in the Church not to permit the election and peaceful admission of one who cannot legitimately be Pope.** Wherefore, **from evident knowledge of a legitimate election and peaceful acceptance, we conclude with certainty that this man lacks none of the requirements for the Pontificate, and that God has conferred upon him the Pontificate of Saint Peter.** [...] **What is asserted concerning a private priest does not press the point: because God did not promise that special providence in these private cases**, because the matter is of lighter moment and can occur without prejudice to the faith, **but the election of a pseudo-pontiff is otherwise.**

But to that which is said, that whoever would withdraw from the modern Supreme Pontiff would indeed be schismatic and not heretical; therefore it is not a matter of faith that he himself is the Supreme Pontiff [...]

I respond that although schism and heresy differ in their formal nature [...] **If, however, someone were to withdraw with an error of understanding, whereby he would not believe that the one whom the Church has received and retains as Supreme Pontiff is truly the Supreme Pontiff, he would indeed be a heretic**, provided that the aforementioned proposition certainly and immutably pertains to the faith.

## RESOLUTION VIII.

I respond that, **even standing with the opinion of those Doctors who assert that it is not a matter of faith that this Pontiff is truly the Pontiff, it would not follow from this that the decrees made by him are not infallible.** [...] Johannes Malderus [...] speaks thus: **"For in order that what the Pope determines should be a matter of faith, it is not required that it be a matter of Divine faith that he who makes the determination is the true Pontiff, but it suffices that this be most certain. Now it is most certain that he whom the universal Church receives as Pontiff is the true Pontiff. For this pertains to God's promise to prevent the Church from being deceived in such a judgment."**
