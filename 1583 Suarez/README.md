## Tractatus Primus, Disputatio V, Sectio VIII

*Whether the Supreme Pontiff, even without a General Council, is an infallible rule of faith?*

**12.** *On the third point.* — In the final argument, a question is raised that was highly controversial in previous years: whether it is a matter of faith that this Pontiff is the true Pontiff. **I cannot now discuss this with the thoroughness it deserves; briefly, however, many believe this is not a matter of faith, but they can scarcely maintain the certainty of faith in matters defined by the Pontiff unless they consequently say that not only a true Pontiff, but also one who is merely recognized as such by the Church, cannot err in defining, which Bellarminus affirms above. I myself, however, nearly thirty years ago, that is, in the year of our Lord 1585, taught in Rome that it is a matter of faith that this Pontiff is the true Pontiff, after he has been received by sufficient consensus of the whole Church and so approved that all are bound to obey him, even in definitions of faith, because this obligation necessarily presupposes that certain faith, and that particular truth is sufficiently contained in the universal dogma of faith, *that the successor of Peter is the true Pontiff*; and then it is sufficiently applied and proposed to the faithful.** This opinion was subsequently defended by our scholars either in public disputations or some even committed it to print. Among these, one may consult Alphonsus Salmeron, book 4 on the Epistles of Paul, second part, disputation on the Church, well before the middle, from the section *The angels also*; Albertinus, volume 1, corollary 3 Theological, from the third philosophical principle, question 3, from number 10; Valentia, above, in § 38, verse *Second reason*, although his proof is not very conclusive. The remaining points can be seen in the authors cited above.

## Tractatus Primus, Disputatio X, Sectio V

*Whether it can be known with certainty of faith that this particular man is the true Pontiff and head of the Church.*

**2.** *His followers Cano, Vega and others.—The truer assertion.—Demonstrated first, from Councils.—Second, from reason, by inconvenience.—Third, from papal power itself.* — Because of these arguments, some among Catholics deny that it can be held immediately by faith that this particular person is the true Pontiff, but only with a certain moral certainty, which they say is sufficient to obligate us to obey him in all things, even in believing matters which he has defined to be of faith. These are Turrecremata, in book 4 of his Summa, part 2, ch. 9, at the end; Albertinus, in De Agnoscendis assertionibus, etc., question 3, at the end; Cajetan in II-II, question 1, art. 3, in response to the 4th; Bannez, II-II, question 1, art. 10, in his earlier commentaries, doubt 2, to the 2nd; Cano and Vega, whom I cited, disputation 6, section 4, n. 3; Corduba, book 1, question 17, § 2; Castro, book 1 against Heresies, ch. 9, near the middle, from Christian Axiomata, book 2, art. 6, ch. 11, and others. There is, however, among these authors some difference, at least in their manner of speaking. For some[^1], although they deny that it is immediately of faith that this Pontiff, for example, Gregory XIII, is the true Pontiff, nevertheless maintain that it is mediately of faith, because from one premise of faith, that he who is rightly elected is the true Pontiff, and another naturally known, that this man has been rightly elected, the conclusion follows. But we have elsewhere refuted this distinction. Others say that this conclusion savors of faith from the same foundation, because it is deduced from one premise of faith and another naturally knowable. Thus in a word they could call it Theological. Others finally simply pronounce that it does not pertain to faith. I, however, prefer the contrary opinion; **and I say that, just as Christ's visible Church is this particular one, so it can have this particular visible head, and therefore it is of faith that this man, who has been accepted by the common consensus of the Church as the head of the Church, whom the Church herself is bound to obey, is the true Pontiff, the successor of Peter. This is proven first from Councils, and above all in the Bull of Martin V, at the Council of Constance, it is ordered that from heretics who wish to be reconciled to the Catholic Church, it should first of all be demanded whether they believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time (his name being expressly stated), is the successor of Peter, and has supreme power in the Church of God; this therefore, as the Pontiff supposes, is to be believed by faith, nor is anything proposed by Pontiffs for immediate belief with less than the certainty of faith.** Moreover, Councils do not distinguish between the true Pontiff in general and this one who now sits with the full consensus of the Church, but embrace them with the same veneration and faith; thus certainly the Council of Chalcedon received Leo the Pope by name; the Sixth Synod, Agatho; the Council of Milevis, Innocent I; and so for the rest. **Secondly, if it can never be established by Catholic faith that this is the true Pontiff, consequently it cannot be established that this is a true Council, which would be no less heretical than to deny that the four Gospels are true, as Gregory the Great said; since a true Council formally includes a true Pontiff, and because of such inclusion we say that it is just as immediately of faith that Christ is an animal, a living substance, as it is that He is a man; wherefore if it were never of Catholic faith that this is the true Pontiff, neither would his decrees ever be of such faith, which is heretical. See the decree of Pope Leo, chapter *De libellis*, distinction 20. Indeed, not even the Catholic truth and certainty of this particular Church could properly stand, because this depends greatly on connection with the true head, and requires true and legitimate priests, pastors, and ecclesiastical hierarchy; but all these things depend on the fact that the true and legitimate Pontiff in the individual case is certain, and by whatever reasoning I could doubt about this Pontiff, I could also doubt about his predecessor, and thus about the whole series going back; therefore about the truth of the Bishops and Cardinals who have been created by these; and thus the whole certainty of the true Church and hierarchical order would collapse: as heretics argue, contending that at least from the time of Pope Urban the true succession has failed; for from this they think they sufficiently infer that it can no longer be certain whether one truly succeeds the Supreme Pontiff, or where in the world the true visible Church exists.** From which, furthermore, I argue, thirdly, from the power of defining matters of faith, and of obligating to believe what has been defined; for it is impossible that I am bound to believe those things which this man defines as spoken by God, unless I am also bound to believe by faith that this man has from God the power of defining, and the assistance of the Holy Spirit, and the power to oblige me to believe what he himself defines; but this is plainly to believe that this man is the Supreme Pontiff.

**3.** The Evasion of Adversaries. — It is Rejected. — Nor indeed can we accept what some respond, that it is sufficient to believe with moral certainty that this person is the true Pontiff, since the Pontiff merely serves as one who applies and proposes the faith, and we have said in previous discussions that, on the part of the one proposing, moral certainty is sufficient for belief. That statement is true when considering matters proposed as objects of belief, and insofar as they are proclaimed by the proximate proposer or minister of the Gospel as matters already defined and certain elsewhere. **But the case is different regarding the person whom I must embrace as the infallible rule of faith, that is, the one who defines the matters of faith. This is illustrated by an analogy: for in order to believe by divine faith what is contained in Scripture, it is not enough to believe with moral certainty, but one must believe with Catholic faith that Scripture itself is divine. The Pontiff, however, is as much a rule of faith as Scripture, as is evident from disputation 5, section 5.** The reason is that the things contained in Scripture or defined by the Pontiff, in order to be true, do not depend merely on the fact that it is credible, even evidently so, that this is Scripture or that this is the Supreme Pontiff, but on the fact that it is truly and infallibly so. Therefore, one must believe with as much certainty that this is truly the case as one believes those things which the Pontiff himself defines.

**5.** *The other escape is precluded in multiple ways.* Perhaps they will say that [the Pope] has all power with respect to acts of jurisdiction alone, but not of orders. But this is opposed, first, because the plenary power of jurisdiction is founded in some manner on the power of orders, such that it necessarily presupposes it, nor can the full power of the Supreme Pontiff, which pertains to the governance of the Church, exist separated from the interior power and in the forum of penance; indeed, in the Pontiff there are not properly two powers, but a single eminent one, comprehending both. Whence I finally conclude that it involves a contradiction to assert that this man has supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole Church, while denying that it is held by faith that he is the Supreme Pontiff; because one would already be affirming that the definition, so to speak, applies to this man, but not the thing defined; and I pronounce the same concerning belief that this man has the power of defining, or has truly defined in act with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, for all these things pertain to jurisdiction inseparable from the true Pontiff. From this it is also understood how those who deny that it is held by faith that this man is the true Pontiff can nevertheless believe by faith what is defined by him, for in reality and in fact they believe him to be the Pontiff, since they believe he has the power and privilege of the Supreme Pontiff: yet from a certain ignorance they think they do not believe. Whence from ignorance they fall into a kind of contradiction.

**7.** *To the second argument in the same place.* — To the second, it is answered that this truth depends on human testimony just as faith depends on the one who proposes it, and therefore nothing detracts from the certainty of faith. Concerning the other required conditions, it must be said that they do not per se primarily pertain to faith, but are, as it were, theological conclusions which are inferred by a certain logical sequence. **For just as means follow from ends, so from the fact that God has granted to the Church that she may never err and that she may always use a true rule in matters of faith to be believed, He consequently, by special care, arranges that he who is elected to such a dignity should have all those conditions which are necessary for truly assuming it.**

**8.** *To the third point ibid.* — To the third, the antecedent is denied, for there exists no history worthy of faith concerning this matter. **It has indeed sometimes happened that the Church did not recognize a true and certain pastor for some time; but that the entire Church conspired in favor of one false head, specifically believing to be a true Pope one who was not true, has never happened.** Nor can an argument be drawn from the former inconvenience to the latter, for they are not equivalent. That the Church might not recognize a certain pastor for some time is indeed no small detriment to the Church; however, it does not expose her to the danger of false dogmas and of some perpetual and, as it were, irreparable damage, because all those things which are enacted during that time by doubtful Pontiffs cannot be valid without true pontifical authority. Hence, they are not considered certain until they are established by an undoubted Pope. But if a false Pontiff were held to be undoubted, all things defined and done by him would be considered most certain, when they would not, in fact, be infallible.

**9.** *To the fourth point ibid.* — To the fourth, it is answered that this perhaps occurs because this opinion of ours is not a matter of faith. Secondly, it is said that all schisms almost always arise before a true Pontiff is received without controversy by the universal Church. However, if some person or particular Church now denied obedience to, for example, Gregory XIII, while simultaneously denying that he is the true Pontiff and successor of Peter, **I do not see how such a one could be excused from heresy any more than if they denied that the Roman Bishop is the successor of Peter.**
