b)\ From these things, moreover, one understands the distinction in the condition of the Church itself during the *vacant see* and during the *occupied see*. During that former time of the vacant Apostolic See, by divine law a successor of Peter, the visible rock and visible head of the Church, *is owed but does not yet exist*; during the time of the occupied see, he already *actually sits* by divine law. What comes primarily into consideration is the very root of the whole life of the Church, namely the indefectibility of faith and the infallible guardianship of the deposit. **Certainly not only the indefectibility *in believing* (which they call passive infallibility) but also infallibility *in preaching* revealed truth already sufficiently proposed for the Catholic faith remains in the Church, even while it is temporarily deprived of its visible head, so that neither the whole body of the Church in believing nor the whole Episcopate in teaching can fall away from the handed-down faith and slip into heresy.** This is because such permanence of the Spirit of truth in the Church—the kingdom, bride, and body of Christ—is included in the very promise and institution of the indefectibility of the Church *for all days* until the consummation of the age. **The same thing that is said about the truth of faith against heresy must also be said, for the same reason, about the unity of communion against universal schism. For the divine law and promise of perpetual succession in the See of Peter as the root and center of Catholic unity remains, and corresponding to this law and promise on the part of the Church is not only the right and duty, but also the indefectibility in legitimately procuring and accepting succession and in preserving the unity of communion with the Petrine See even when vacant, in view of the successor who is awaited and who will indefectibly come:** "And the glory (τὴν δόξαν) which you have given me, *I have given to them, that they may be one*, as we also are one: I in them, and you in me, *that they may be made perfect in one* (τετελειωμενοι εἰς ἕν)" John XVII. 22.

**Scholion.** It seems appropriate at this point to very briefly set forth our opinion on the manner in which the extinction of that most disastrous schism and the restoration of the full unity of the Church, or rather the actual communion of all Catholics with the legitimate heir of the Apostolic See, appears to us to be explained. **For although all theologians, indeed the entire Church, are in complete agreement regarding the *fact itself* of the extinction of the schism through the legitimate and undoubted election of Martin V as the one true successor of Peter, nevertheless the same consensus does not prevail—indeed, no slight discrepancy of opinions occurs among theologians and interpreters of law—when the question concerns the *manner* by which that happy outcome was legitimately reached.** Now, especially after the lucid and explicit definitions of the Vatican Council concerning the divine rights of the primacy and the relations that exist between it and the entire rest of the Church, in order to resolve the proposed question more certainly and firmly, we must keep in view the dogmatic principles that are contained in those very definitions of the Council or necessarily follow from them.

4º.\ Neither into formal heresy nor into material heresy, by positively denying what has been revealed, or by affirming as revealed what has not been revealed, can the *entire* Church, the kingdom of truth, fall according to the promise of the Spirit of truth who remains in it forever; **by the same reasoning, from the promise of perpetual unity, whose center and visible bond is the Roman Pontiff, the *entire* Church, the body of Christ, can never be separated from the true and legitimate Roman Pontiff, its visible head, either by formal or material schism.** If at times such a secession of the whole Church seems to have occurred, as in the final years of Pedro de Luna who had been called Benedict XIII, this is not a defection from the true and legitimate Pontiff depriving him of his power, which cannot happen (n. 3.); **but a certain sign that he was never a true and legitimate Pontiff**. Therefore, what is stated by many as an axiom to explain the acts of the Councils of Pisa and Constance: "A doubtful Pope is no Pope"; this is true only if the doubt and secession due to that doubt encompasses the entire Church; but it cannot be admitted if, after a Pontiff has been legitimately established, doubts and secessions arise in a part, even in the majority part of the Church, because of induced disturbances.

[...]

Having established these principles, we cannot understand how one could admit the opinion of those who, in explaining the acts of the Council of Constance, say with Bellarmine and Suárez that the right of all three claimants to the pontificate at that time was doubtful because the individual obediences (as the parties adhering to different Pontiffs were called) regarded two of them as illegitimate; and thus, they argue, a doubtful Pontiff is not a true Pontiff, or as we heard Suárez stating: "it could be that none of them was a certain Pontiff and therefore not a Pontiff at all, because none of them had yet been received by a sufficient consensus of the Church." **But one who is legitimately elected is thereby constituted a true Pontiff not by the Church but by Christ himself (n. 1), nor is the "sufficient consensus" of the Church required or to be awaited as a *condition for him to be a true Pontiff*; rather, "sufficient consensus" certainly follows from Christ's prayer and promise for the unity of His Church according to the duty of *obedience, because he is a true Pontiff* (n. 4).** Moreover, it is evident that at Constance, regarding both the manner of election and the legitimate electors themselves, many things were decreed and performed that were outside of and contrary to the laws established by the supreme authority of the Roman Pontiffs Alexander III, Gregory X, and Clement V for a valid election. But such a change and suspension of laws of the supreme authority could only be made by the supreme authority of the Roman Pontiff itself, as follows from the divinely constituted relationship of subjection of *the entire Church* under the power of the Supreme Pastor, and as we have seen Suárez also admit: "because a lower power cannot change what has been constituted by a higher power, and because primacy was given to Peter alone for himself and his successors, it belongs to him alone or to the Supreme Pontiff... to prescribe *the manner of his election and succession*" (see above th. XII. n. III). Now if at that time there was no *true Pontiff*, because (as these theologians say) none was indubitable and certain, it is manifest that the assembly of Constance would have acted by an inferior power against the manner of election prescribed by the supreme authority of the Supreme Pontiffs. Nor was the prescribed manner of election only changed by adding to the Cardinals also other Bishops and simple priests as electors, who did not even belong to the Clergy of the Roman Church; but difficulties existed regarding even the Cardinals themselves taken from the three obediences, which I see neither solved nor even mentioned by those theologians, nor indeed do I perceive how they could be solved in their hypothesis. For if for almost forty years (from March 27, 1378, when Gregory XI died, until the election of Martin V on November 11, 1417) there is said to have been no true Pontiff, how could all those Cardinals created by those pseudo-pontiffs be considered legitimate, who nevertheless, although taken from different obediences and appointed by opposing pontiffs, recognized each other as legitimate in the Councils of Pisa and Constance, and, contrary to the pontiffs by whom they were created, claimed all the rights of Cardinals for themselves? Further, if the election of Urban VI (April 8, 1378) was invalid, how was the second election of Clement VII (September 20, 1378) not valid? **But if, which can no longer be rightly called into doubt, Urban was truly created and acknowledged by those very Cardinals who later defected, by public acts and written letters at least until the month of June, as the legitimate successor of St. Peter,** how because of the subsequent secession and the doubt gradually spread to many by evil arts did he lose the pontificate, which he held not from the Cardinals nor from the Church but immediately conferred by Christ God? If therefore he could not be despoiled of the divinely conferred pontificate by the acts of any men whatsoever, but remained until his death (October 15, 1389, in his Roman See) the true successor of Peter, without doubt his successors elected according to all the established laws—Boniface IX, Innocent VII, Gregory XII—were true and legitimate successors in the See of Peter. **Those doubts that were introduced and spread by the offended Cardinals after Urban's already established election and recognition, which were indeed then extended to his successors,** could only accomplish what we stated above, that those attached to the parties of Robert of Geneva (Clement VII) and his successor Peter de Luna (Benedict XIII), or subsequently Alexander V, elected by the Pisans (June 26, 1409), and his successor John XXIII, were not formally but only materially schismatic, and therefore among them there could be found even holy men; but neither those doubts, nor what consequently followed them in the assembly of Pisa through the election of yet a third who would assume the name of Roman Pontiff, could take away from Urban VI and his validly elected successors the dignity and power over the universal Church. The accusation of schism and "notorious heresy" brought by the Pisans against Gregory XII, that as a supporter and defender of an inveterate schism he was denying the revealed truth of the unity of the Church, and had therefore fallen from the pontificate, involves a contradiction; for if he was a true Pontiff having from Christ supreme power over the universal Church, by defending this his power against adversaries who were at least materially schismatic, he neither in fact opposed, much less denied in principle, the unity of the Church instituted by Christ, especially in its head and under its visible head. Nor was "that notorious heresy" of Gregory or the truth of the Pisan judgment ever acknowledged by the Council of Constance itself, as will soon appear. Yet it is not therefore necessary to deny that Gregory, in that disturbance of the Church, was obliged to voluntarily resign and that by resisting this obligation he could have sinned; but that a Pontiff can be deprived of his power for sins other than heresy is an assertion condemned in article 8 of Wycliffe and in articles 12, 13, 20, 22, 24 of John Hus by the definition of Martin V in the Council of Constance itself.
