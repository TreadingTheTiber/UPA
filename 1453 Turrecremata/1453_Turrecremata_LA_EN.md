| **Cap. IX. De multiplici genere sive gradu catholicarum veritatum.** | | **Liber Quartus, Pars II, Capitulum IX On the Multiple Kinds or Degrees of Catholic Truths** |
| *Primum genus catholicarum veritatum.* | | *The First Kind of Catholic Truths.* |
| DATA definitione catholicae veritatis, cum notum sit inter veritates catholicas plurimas esse veritates quibus firma credulitate adhaerendum sit, opportunum duximus gradus sive genera eorum distinguere, videtur autem nobis septem posse distingui genera catholicarum veritatum. Primum est eorum quae in canone sacrae scripturae veteris aut novi testamenti, & in propria verborum forma continentur. Et huiusmodi genus veritatum catholicarum potest distingui etiam secundum tria genera credibilium supra posita, inter quae ut praediximus principalius annumerandum est genus credibilium quae ante creduntur quam intelligatur cuiusmodi sunt ea quae ad articulos fidei pertinent, ex quibus principaliter salus nostra pendet. Quod autem huiusmodi veritates in sacra scriptura formaliter contentae catholicae veniant reputandae manifestum est, cum de veritate sacrae scripturae nullo modo dubitandum sit, unde beatus Augustinus libro de unico baptismo, ut recitatur in cap. quis nesciat dist.9. ait. Quis nesciat sanctam scripturam canonicam tam veteris quam novi testamenti certis terminis contineri, eamque posteris omnium episcoporum litteris ita praeponi ut de illa omnino dubitari vel disceptari non possit, utrum verum vel utrum rectum sit quicquid in ea scriptum constituerit, &c. | | HAVING provided a definition of Catholic truth, since it is known that among Catholic truths there are many truths to which one must adhere with firm belief, we have deemed it opportune to distinguish their degrees or kinds, and it seems to us that seven kinds of Catholic truths can be distinguished. The first consists of those that are contained in the canon of Sacred Scripture of the Old or New Testament, and in the proper form of words. And this kind of Catholic truths can also be distinguished according to the three kinds of credible things set forth above, among which, as we have previously stated, the more principal kind to be enumerated is that of credible things which are believed before they are understood, of which kind are those pertaining to the articles of faith, upon which our salvation principally depends. That truths of this kind, formally contained in Sacred Scripture, are to be considered Catholic is manifest, since the truth of Sacred Scripture is in no way to be doubted. Hence blessed Augustine in his book "On the One Baptism," as recited in chapter "Who does not know," distinction 9, says: "Who does not know that the Holy Canonical Scripture, both of the Old and New Testament, is contained within certain limits, and that it is so set above all subsequent letters of bishops that one cannot at all doubt or dispute whether what is written in it is true or whether what it has established is right, etc." |
| Secundum genus veritatum catholicarum est earum quae ex solis contentis in sacra scriptura consequentia necessaria, & formali possunt inferri. Unde cum tales veritates eandem veritatis firmitatem, & credulitatis necessitatem habeant quam habent veritates ex quibus necessaria, & formali consequentia inferuntur, manifestum est eas inter catholicas veritates numerari, sicut est haec veritas, Christus est verus Deus & verus homo, quae licet in tota serie sacrae scripturae sic formaliter non inveniatur, nihilominus quia ex contentis in sacra scriptura consequentia formali, & necessaria infertur catholica tenetur, & eam credere necessarium est ad salutem. | | The second category of Catholic truths consists of those which can be inferred by necessary and formal consequence from the contents of Sacred Scripture alone. Since such truths possess the same firmness of truth and necessity of belief as the truths from which they are derived by necessary and formal consequence, it is manifest that they are counted among Catholic truths. Such is the truth that Christ is true God and true man, which, although not found formally expressed in these exact terms throughout the whole series of Sacred Scripture, is nevertheless held as Catholic and necessary to believe for salvation, because it is inferred by formal and necessary consequence from what is contained in Sacred Scripture. |
| Tertium genus veritatum catholicarum est eorum quae circa canonem sacrae scripturae continentur, quae tamen per revelationem, & approbationem tantum mediantibus apostolis ad fideles devenerunt. Sane cum Christus cum viveret in carne mortali cum apostolis multa docuerit, & fecerit quae in canone sanctae scripturae non habentur secundum illud Ioan. ult. Multa alia fecit Iesus: quae non sunt scripta in libro hoc. Multas alias veritates catholicas Christus apostolos docuerit docendas per eos quae in canone scripturae non habentur. Unde Augustinus tertio de baptismo parvulorum dicit. Illa quae non scripta servat universalis ecclesia acceperit ab apostolis Christo docente, sic enim Apostolus de corporis, & sanguinis dominici communione 1. ad Corin. 11. dicit. Quod accepi a domino hoc tradidi vobis, cetera autem cum venero disponam, id est ordinabo. Item ad idem est idem Augustinus qui ut habetur in ca. ecclesiasticarum dist.11. ita ad propositum dicit. Ecclesiasticarum constitutionum quasdam scripturis, quasdam vero apostoli traditione per successores in ministerio confirmatas suscepimus, quasdam vero consuetudine roboratas approbavit usus quibus par ritus, & idem utriusque pietatis debetur affectus. Haec ille. Amplius cum secundum provisionem Christi spiritus sanctus superventurus in discipulos docturus esset eos omnem veritatem, multa profecto credendi sunt a spiritu sancto didicisse quae postea fideles docuerunt, quae tamen in canone bibliae posita non fuerunt. Unde Alexander tertius in cap. cum marte. extra de celebra. miss. super forma consecrationis eucharistiae loquens ita ait. Sane multa tam de verbis quam de factis dominicis invenimus ab evangelistis omissa quae etiam apostoli vel supplevissent verbo vel facto exposuisse leguntur. Paulus enim in actibus apostolorum sic ait. Meminisse nos oportet verbum domini nostri Iesu Christi qui dixit. Beatus est dare quam accipere. Hoc tamen nullus quattuor evangelistarum descripsit: unde gloss. Act.3. & gloss.1. Thero. ait. Hoc in evangelio non legitur, non enim omnia scripta sunt sed forsitan Paulus hoc ab apostolis audiit vel a spiritu sancto percepit. Et idem prosequitur magister Nicolaus de Lyra in expositione. Unde tales veritates, & quae ex eius consequentia necessaria immutabiliter possunt inferri inter catholicas veritates veniunt computandae. | | The third category of Catholic truths consists of those contained in the canon of sacred scripture, which nevertheless came to the faithful through revelation and approval, with the apostles serving as intermediaries. Indeed, while Christ was living in mortal flesh with the apostles, He taught and did many things that are not contained in the canon of holy scripture, according to the passage in the last chapter of John: "Jesus did many other things which are not written in this book." Christ taught the apostles many other Catholic truths to be taught by them which are not contained in the canon of scripture. Thus Augustine, in the third book on the baptism of infants, says: "Those things which are not written down but which the universal Church observes were received from the apostles as Christ taught them." So the Apostle, concerning the communion of the Lord's body and blood in 1 Corinthians 11, says: "What I received from the Lord, this I handed on to you; the rest I will arrange when I come," that is, "I will order." Likewise, to the same effect is Augustine himself who, as is found in the chapter "Ecclesiasticarum," distinction 11, speaks to the point thus: "Of ecclesiastical constitutions, some we have received through scriptures, others indeed through apostolic tradition confirmed by successors in ministry, and others strengthened by custom which usage has approved; to all of these equal reverence and the same devotion of piety is owed." Thus he speaks. Furthermore, since according to Christ's provision, the Holy Spirit was to come upon the disciples to teach them all truth, we must certainly believe that they learned many things from the Holy Spirit which they later taught to the faithful, yet which were not placed in the canon of the Bible. Hence Alexander III, in the chapter "Cum Marte," in the section on the celebration of Mass, speaking about the form of consecration of the Eucharist, says thus: "Indeed, we find many things both from the words and from the deeds of the Lord omitted by the evangelists which the apostles are also read to have supplemented by word or explained by deed. For Paul in the Acts of the Apostles says thus: 'We ought to remember the word of our Lord Jesus Christ who said: It is more blessed to give than to receive.'" Yet none of the four evangelists described this; whence the gloss on Acts 3 and the gloss of St. Jerome says: "This is not read in the gospel, for not all things have been written, but perhaps Paul heard this from the apostles or received it from the Holy Spirit." And Nicholas of Lyra follows this in his exposition. Therefore, such truths, and those which can be inferred by necessary consequence immutably from them, are to be counted among Catholic truths. |
| Quartum genus veritatum catholicarum est earum quae ab ecclesia universali in conciliis plenariis tanquam ad fidem christianae religionis pertinentia definita sunt, licet expresse in canone scripturae sacrae non inveniantur. Et ratio huius manifesta est: quoniam ut superius lib.3.cap.58. amplissime, & irrefragabiliter ostendimus concilia plenaria universalis ecclesiae in his quae fidei sunt errare non possunt. Unde beatus Gregorius in ca. sicut distinct.15. ait, quod sicut sancti evangelii quattuor libros sic quattuor concilia suscipere, & venerari me fateor. Et ratio est: quoniam ut ait beatus Gregorius in tractatu qui intitulatur de catholica veritate. Sicut Deus veritas est ita ea quae apostolica ecclesia de Deo docuit vera sunt. Unde merito dicitur Prover. primo. Ne dimittas legem matris tuae gloss. ecclesiae. Notanter autem dictum est. Quae apostolica ecclesia docuit; licet definitione iudiciali esse credenda. Quod dicitur propter multa quae in ecclesia legi a fidelibus permittuntur, & tolerantur quae omnia credere non est de necessitate salutis, nec inter catholicas veritates sunt reputandae licet multae earum pie a fidelibus credantur, sicut sunt multa contenta in legendis sive historiis sanctorum, & vitis patrum, quae cum manifeste non cognoscantur falsa esse: sed potius habere aliquam probabilitatis apparentiam, possunt credi pro eo quod ad commovendos pios actus fidelium ad devotionem proficiunt secure leguntur, & pie creduntur dum tamen animus assertione pertinaci illis non adhaereat. | | The fourth category of Catholic truths consists of those which have been defined by the universal Church in plenary councils as pertaining to the faith of the Christian religion, although they may not be found expressly in the canon of Sacred Scripture. And the reason for this is manifest: since, as we have most amply and irrefutably demonstrated above in Book 3, Chapter 58, plenary councils of the universal Church cannot err in matters of faith. Hence, blessed Gregory, in Canon "Sicut," Distinction 15, says that just as I profess to receive and venerate the four books of the holy Gospel, so also the four councils. And the reason is: because, as blessed Gregory says in the treatise entitled "On Catholic Truth," just as God is truth, so those things which the Apostolic Church has taught about God are true. Whence it is rightly said in Proverbs, chapter one: "Do not forsake the law of your mother" – the gloss adds: "the Church." Note, however, that it is specifically said: "What the Apostolic Church has taught"; though by judicial definition it is to be believed. This is said because of many things which are permitted to be read by the faithful in the Church, and are tolerated, not all of which are necessary to believe for salvation, nor are they to be counted among Catholic truths, although many of these are piously believed by the faithful. Such are many contents in the legends or histories of the saints and the lives of the fathers, which, since they are not manifestly known to be false, but rather have some appearance of probability, can be believed insofar as they profit towards moving the pious acts of the faithful to devotion; they are safely read and piously believed, provided that one does not adhere to them with pertinacious assertion. |
| Quintum genus catholicarum veritatum elt earum quae in materia fidei apostolicae sedis iudicio definite sunt, quae licet in canone scripturae sacrae non reperiantur contineri, sunt tamen inter catholicas veritates computandae: quoniam sicut in superioribus tam auctoritatibus quam rationibus manifeste ostendimus li.2. cap.109. Apostolicae sedis iudicium in his quae fidei sunt errare a veritate non potest. Pro quo facit promissio illa Christi. Luc. 22. Ego rogavi pro te ut non deficiat fides tua, & tu aliquando conversus confirma fratres tuos. Quod etiam apertissime confirmare videtur beatus Augu. in cap. in canonicis distinct. 19. ubi inter canonicas scripturas computandas ponit epistolas quas apostolica sedes habere meruit & ali meruerunt ab ea accipere. Item Agapro papa in cap. sic. eadem distinct. ubi ita ait. Sic omnes apostolicae sedis sanctiones accipiendae sunt tanquam ipsius divina voce Petri firmatae. Item beatus Hiero. luce clarissima hoc confirmat in c. haec est fides 24. q.1. ubi sic dicit. Si haec nostra confessio apostolatus tui iudicio approbatur, quicunque me calumniare voluerit se imperitum, & malivolum vel non esse catholicum sed haereticum comprobabit. | | The fifth category of Catholic truths consists of those that have been definitively determined by the judgment of the Apostolic See in matters of faith, which, although they may not be found contained in the canon of Sacred Scripture, are nevertheless to be counted among Catholic truths. For as we have clearly demonstrated in the preceding sections, both by authorities and by reasoned arguments in Book 2, Chapter 109, the judgment of the Apostolic See in matters of faith cannot deviate from the truth. This is supported by that promise of Christ in Luke 22: "I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren." This also seems to be most explicitly confirmed by blessed Augustine in the chapter "In canonicis," Distinction 19, where he places among the canonical writings those epistles which the Apostolic See had the merit to possess and others deserved to receive from it. Likewise, Pope Agapetus in the chapter "Sic," in the same Distinction, where he states thus: "All the sanctions of the Apostolic See are to be accepted as though confirmed by the divine voice of Peter himself." Likewise, blessed Jerome most clearly confirms this in the chapter "Haec est fides," 24, Question 1, where he says thus: "If this our confession is approved by the judgment of your Apostolate, whoever wishes to calumniate me will prove himself to be inexperienced and malevolent, or not Catholic but heretical." |
| Sextum genus veritatum catholicarum videtur esse earum quae de tenenda fide & confutatione haereticorum a doctoribus ab universali ecclesia approbatis assertive traditae sunt, licet in canone scripturae sacrae expresse non contineantur. patet hoc: quoniam cum ecclesia universalis quae regitur spiritu sancto doctores aliquos approbavit, eorum doctrinam tanquam veram recipiens, necesse est ut talium doctrina assertive posita, & nunquam alias retractata vera sit & ab omnibus fidelibus firma credulitate tenenda in parte in qua ab universali ecclesia est recepta, alias universalis ecclesia videretur errasse approbando, & acceptando eorum doctrinam tanquam veram quae tamen vera non esset. Qui autem sunt hi doctores per universalem ecclesiam in universalibus conciliis approbati colligitur ex 5. concilio universali, in quo ut san. Thom. refert in 4. contra gentiles cap.24. ita habetur. Sequimur per omnia sanctos patres, & doctores ecclesiae. Athanasium, Hilarium, Basilium, Gregorium, Theologum, & Gregorium Nicenum, Ambrosium, Augustinum, Theophilum, Ioannem Constantinopolitanum Cyrillum, Leonem Porcium, & suscipimus omnia quae de recta, fide & condemnatione haereticorum exposuerunt. Haec ibi. Postea vero papa Gelasius in synodo sua alios doctores approbando addit, ut patet in canone sancta Romana ecclesia distinct. 15. Verum circa approbationem opusculorum praefatorum doctorum est advertendum, & notandum quod synodus nodus universalis quinta non approbavit simpliciter omnia contenta in opusculis praetatorum doctorum, sed tantum ea quae de recta fide, & condemnatione haereticorum exposuerunt. Per quod satis datur intelligi quod per hoc cp opuscula aliquorum doctorum approbavit vel approbat ecclesia: non est necesse cp omnia in eis contenta approbata intelligantur, sed tantum quo ad ea quae de recta fide, & de condemnatione haereticorum exposuerunt quae tamquam necessaria ad credendum fidelibus tradiderunt. Nec per consequens ex approbatione praefata habetur quod omnes veritates in praefatorum sanctorum doctorum opusculis contentae sint tanquam catholicae veritatis habendae, sed tantum veritates praefati generis, quae de recta fide & condemnatione haereticorum exposuerunt. Multa alia quidem sunt in eis contenta alterius generis. Eprobabilitatis. unde Aug. qui de numero approbatorum per universalem ecclesiam est, inquit ad Vincentium Victorem, & habetur in ca. negare non possum di.9. Negare non possum inquiens, nec debeo sicuti in ipsis maioribus, id est scriptis maiorum, ita multa esse in tam multis opusculis meis quae possunt iusto iudicio, & nulla temeritate culpari. Nec obviat praefato generi catholicarum veritatum illud quod beatus Augu. dicit in ca. noli. & in ca. ego solus di.9. Quoniam ut glo. inquit in ca. noli. Augu. loquitur secundum illa tempora cum adhuc scriptura Aug. & aliorum sanctorum patrum non erat autentica, sed hodie iubentur omnia teneri usque ad ultimum iota, ut di.15.c.ulti. | | The sixth category of Catholic truths appears to be those that have been taught assertively by doctors approved by the universal Church concerning the holding of faith and refutation of heretics, even though they are not expressly contained in the canon of sacred scripture. This is evident because: since the universal Church, which is governed by the Holy Spirit, has approved certain doctors, receiving their doctrine as true, it is necessary that the doctrine positively set forth by such men, and never elsewhere retracted, be true and held with firm belief by all the faithful in that part which has been received by the universal Church. Otherwise, the universal Church would seem to have erred in approving and accepting their doctrine as true when it was not truly so. Who these doctors are, approved by the universal Church in universal councils, is gathered from the Fifth Universal Council, in which, as Saint Thomas relates in the fourth book of Contra Gentiles, chapter 24, it is stated thus: "We follow in all things the holy fathers and doctors of the Church: Athanasius, Hilary, Basil, Gregory the Theologian [Nazianzen], Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, Augustine, Theophilus, John of Constantinople [Chrysostom], Cyril, Leo [the Great], Porcius, and we accept all that they have expounded concerning the right faith and the condemnation of heretics." Thus far that text. Later, Pope Gelasius, in his synod, added other approved doctors, as is evident in the canon "Sancta Romana Ecclesia," Distinction 15. However, concerning the approval of the works of the aforementioned doctors, it should be observed and noted that the Fifth Universal Council did not approve simply everything contained in the works of the aforementioned doctors, but only those things which they expounded concerning the right faith and the condemnation of heretics. By this it is sufficiently given to understand that when the Church has approved or approves the works of certain doctors, it is not necessary to understand that everything contained in them is approved, but only those things which they have expounded concerning the right faith and the condemnation of heretics, which they have handed down to the faithful as necessary to believe. Consequently, from the aforementioned approval, it is not established that all truths contained in the works of the aforementioned holy doctors are to be held as Catholic truths, but only truths of the aforementioned category, which they expounded concerning the right faith and the condemnation of heretics. Indeed, many other things of a different nature are contained in them. And of probability. Hence Augustine, who is among those approved by the universal Church, says to Vincent Victor, and it is found in the chapter "Negare non possum," Distinction 9: "I cannot deny," he says, "nor ought I, that just as in the writings of those greater than me, so in my many works there are many things which can be blamed with just judgment and without any rashness." Nor does that which blessed Augustine says in the chapter "Noli" and in the chapter "Ego solus," Distinction 9, contradict the aforementioned category of Catholic truths. For as the gloss says in the chapter "Noli," Augustine speaks according to those times when the writings of Augustine and other holy fathers were not yet authentic, but today all are commanded to be held even to the last iota, as in Distinction 15, final chapter. |
| Septimum genus catholicarum veritatum est earum quae ex 4.5. & 6. genere catholicarum veritatum consequentia necessaria, & formali inferri possunt. Necessaria, & formali consequentia dicimus, quia si aliquid solum probabili consequentia inferretur non diceretur proprie veritas catholica, sed probabilis tantum. | | The seventh category of Catholic truths consists of those which can be deduced by necessary and formal consequence from the fourth, fifth, and sixth categories of Catholic truths. We say "by necessary and formal consequence" because if something were inferred only by probable consequence, it would not properly be called a Catholic truth, but merely probable. |
| Octavum genus distingui potest earum veritatum quae etsi absolute catholicae non sint: sunt nihilominus catholicam veritatem sapientes, sunt enim catholicis veritatibus propinque. Unde veritas sapiens catholicam veritatem potest sic diffiniri. Veritas sapiens catholicam veritatem sive fidem ex consequenti est illa, quae adiuncta sibi aliqua alia veritate ad fidem non pertinente, sed nihilominus quae rationabiliter negari non potest, fiet veritas catholica. | | An eighth category can be distinguished of those truths which, although not absolutely Catholic, nevertheless savor of Catholic truth, for they are closely related to Catholic truths. Hence, a truth savoring of Catholic truth can be defined thus: A truth savoring of Catholic truth or faith by consequence is that which, when joined with some other truth not pertaining to faith, but which nevertheless cannot reasonably be denied, becomes a Catholic truth. |
| Exempli gratia, quia nunc in apostolica dignitate sedet magister Thomas de Sarzana ista. Thomas de Sarzana est papa, est propositio sapiens veritatem catholicam. Patet quoniam adiuncta sibi illa veritate quae negari non potest, videlicet cp fuerit rite, & canonice electus, utputa a toto dominorum cardinalium collegio vel duabus partibus, efficitur veritas catholica dicenda. | | For example, because Master Thomas of Sarzana now sits in apostolic dignity, the proposition "Thomas of Sarzana is pope" is a proposition savoring of Catholic truth. This is evident because when joined with that truth which cannot be denied, namely that he was duly and canonically elected, as for instance by the entire college of cardinal lords or by two-thirds of them, it becomes a truth to be called Catholic. |
| Magister Thomas de Sarzana rite canonice electus, & in papam ab universali ecclesia susceptus est verus papa, ista propositio est catholica ex determinatione universalis ecclesiae, ut in ca. in nomine domini. Item in epistola decretali Martini de concilio Constantien. Inter credenda cuilibet fideli ponitur, quod papa canonice electus qui pro tempore fuerit eius nomine proprio expresso, sit successor beati Petri habens auctoritatem supremam in ecclesia Dei. | | "Master Thomas of Sarzana, duly and canonically elected, and received as pope by the universal Church, is the true pope" - this proposition is Catholic by determination of the universal Church, as in the chapter "In nomine Domini." Likewise in the decretal epistle of Martin from the Council of Constance, it is placed among the things to be believed by every faithful person that the canonically elected pope who holds office at any given time, his proper name being expressed, is the successor of blessed Peter having supreme authority in the Church of God. |
| Ex praefatis facile est intelligere veritates omnes non esse eiusdem maneriei, sed diversorum generum aut graduum. Quaedam enim ut visum est sunt catholicae, quaedam catholicam veritatem sapientes, & quaedam probabiles tantum, quaedam pie credibiles, quaedam impertinentes. | | From the foregoing it is easy to understand that not all truths are of the same nature, but of different kinds or grades. For some, as has been seen, are Catholic, some savoring of Catholic truth, some merely probable, some piously credible, and some impertinent. |
