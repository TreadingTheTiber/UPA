## Liber Quartus, Pars II, Capitulum IX On the Multiple Kinds or Degrees of Catholic Truths

*The First Kind of Catholic Truths.*

HAVING provided a definition of Catholic truth, since it is known that among Catholic truths there are many truths to which one must adhere with firm belief, we have deemed it opportune to distinguish their degrees or kinds, and it seems to us that seven kinds of Catholic truths can be distinguished. The first consists of those that are contained in the canon of Sacred Scripture of the Old or New Testament, and in the proper form of words. And this kind of Catholic truths can also be distinguished according to the three kinds of credible things set forth above, among which, as we have previously stated, the more principal kind to be enumerated is that of credible things which are believed before they are understood, of which kind are those pertaining to the articles of faith, upon which our salvation principally depends. That truths of this kind, formally contained in Sacred Scripture, are to be considered Catholic is manifest, since the truth of Sacred Scripture is in no way to be doubted. Hence blessed Augustine in his book "On the One Baptism," as recited in chapter "Who does not know," distinction 9, says: "Who does not know that the Holy Canonical Scripture, both of the Old and New Testament, is contained within certain limits, and that it is so set above all subsequent letters of bishops that one cannot at all doubt or dispute whether what is written in it is true or whether what it has established is right, etc."
[...]
An eighth category can be distinguished of those truths which, although not absolutely Catholic, nevertheless savor of Catholic truth, for they are closely related to Catholic truths. Hence, a truth savoring of Catholic truth can be defined thus: **A truth savoring of Catholic truth or faith by consequence is that which, when joined with some other truth not pertaining to faith, but which nevertheless cannot reasonably be denied, becomes a Catholic truth.** For example, because Master Thomas of Sarzana now sits in apostolic dignity, the proposition "Thomas of Sarzana is pope" is a proposition savoring of Catholic truth. This is evident because when joined with that truth which cannot be denied, namely that he was duly and canonically elected, as for instance by the entire college of cardinal lords or by two-thirds of them, it becomes a truth to be called Catholic. **"Master Thomas of Sarzana, duly and canonically elected, and received as pope by the universal Church, is the true pope" - this proposition is Catholic by determination of the universal Church, as in the chapter "In nomine Domini." Likewise in the decretal epistle of Martin from the Council of Constance, it is placed among the things to be believed by every faithful person that the canonically elected pope who holds office at any given time, his proper name being expressed, is the successor of blessed Peter having supreme authority in the Church of God.** From the foregoing it is easy to understand that not all truths are of the same nature, but of different kinds or grades. For some, as has been seen, are Catholic, some savoring of Catholic truth, some merely probable, some piously credible, and some impertinent.
