## Quaestio V, Article II

[...]

**2.** It must be said, however, that it is absolutely a matter of faith that Clement XI, who now reigns after his legitimate election (and assuming this election, about which one cannot doubt, as I will explain below in number 5), is the true successor of Peter in the Papacy. This is proven firstly from the Bull of Martin V issued in the Council of Constance, session 45 and the last, in which, after enumerating the errors of John Wycliffe and John Hus, he ordains and proposes interrogations to be made to those suspected in faith to recognize whether they believe legitimately, among which this is read: *"Likewise let him believe that the canonically elected Pope, whoever he may be at the time, his proper name being expressed, is the successor of Blessed Peter, having supreme authority in the Church of God."* Through this, this position has received great strength, and theologians have become more cautious in this matter.

[...]

**4.** The same minor [premise] can also be supported by another argument, which Lugus [De Lugo] uses in *the cited passage*, namely that this particular [truth] is formally contained in that universal [truth] which has been revealed, by which it is established that the Church cannot be universally deceived in matters of faith, since it is "the pillar and foundation of truth," as the Apostle testifies in 2 Timothy 2. **For in this it seems to be contained no less that the Church cannot err in recognizing the true visible rule of its faith, than in proposing other matters to be believed by Divine faith. Indeed, an error concerning the visible rule of truth and faith would harm the Church more, being an error concerning the foundation, than [an error] concerning other objects proposed by it, just as in speculative matters an error concerning first principles is more harmful than [an error] concerning conclusions.**

**5.** I have said, *supposing his legitimate election*, for this is a condition, such that this particular instance is contained in the universal proposition. Indeed, above in *the cited passage*, we said that, in order for a particular proposition to be believed with Divine Faith as formally revealed in a universal proposition, its formal containment within the universal must be established, and indeed with moral certainty. Let what was said there be recalled, for certain matters were resolved there which apply equally here. **That the election of a particular person as Pope has been performed properly, legitimately, and canonically, and that it is to be regarded as so properly conducted constantly and without any doubt, is established with moral certainty—a certainty that is sensible and experiential—when it has been performed, approved, and received by the whole Church. It is evident that this Pope Clement XI has been made, approved, and received by the whole Church: made, namely, by the Cardinals to whom the Church gave the power of electing the Supreme Pontiff; and accepted and approved with many solemnities, not only by the Cardinals themselves once the election was completed through secret votes, but also by the universal Church considered in itself, and not merely according to the power given to the Cardinals. Indeed, this universal approval and acceptance remedies defects and heals the election in those matters which perhaps could have occurred contrary to the legitimacy of the same election.**

[...]

Then, because the arguments posed here recur: when it is said that this object is in itself objectively of faith immediately, is this said with certainty or only probably? If the first is said, then it can be believed by Divine faith without any apprehension. If the second is said, then neither objectively nor in itself does it pertain to Divine faith immediately, for the term "probably," as it does not exclude apprehension, cannot be joined with the matter of faith, as was well urged above. **For this reason, it does not hold, nor does it have a place, if it is said that Clement XI is probably, but not certainly, the legitimate successor of Peter as a matter of faith, since the term "probably" exceeds all matter of faith, for the reason that it does not exclude all apprehension.**

[...]

**16.** I respond that this argument overturns the status of the present controversy, which is disputed supposing the legitimacy of his election. However, this is supposed not precisely because of its truth or falsity in reality, but because it is true in such a way that there is no grounds for doubting its truth and certainty, insofar as is sufficient for that particular case to be included in that universal such that it may be believed by Divine faith. Therefore, each point must be addressed separately. To the first, I concede the major premise, and therefore I stated above that this is evident through sensible and experiential evidence, which suffices for our intent, and I deny the minor premise. When it is proven, I say that by the very fact that the universal Church peacefully accepts this Pope to be the legitimate Pope, and holds him as the true and legitimate Pope after this acceptance and universal recognition and acclamation, it begins to be a matter of faith that he is the true Pope. **Thus, through this peaceful and universal acceptance by the Church, it is equivalently proposed to all and individual faithful that he is the true Pope as a matter of immediate faith. This being granted, it follows by theological consequence that the conditions and juridical forms prerequisite by Divine and Ecclesiastical law were observed in his election, or if any requirements of Ecclesiastical law were lacking, they were remedied. For regarding these conditions, it is not determinately necessary for a valid election that they be observed, but only disjunctively—either that they be observed, or dispensed with, or remedied—which can also be done, even with the Church of God being Acephalous [headless] and the See vacant, by virtue and authority of preceding Pontiffs so disposing in their Constitutions, about which more will be said below in response to the third argument.**

[...]

**19.** To the second [objection], I concede the major premise, but deny the minor premise, for an election to the Papacy conducted by the Cardinals in the name of the universal Church, along with its peaceful and universal acceptance, establishes moral certainty containing this particular proposition within that universally revealed formal truth, and not merely human faith. Hence, the man thus elected and accepted begins to be numbered among those to whom Christ, in the Person of Peter, said: *"You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, Feed my sheep, Strengthen your brethren"*; thus he begins to fall under the written Word of God.

[...]

**22.** First, one might doubt to whom the power of electing the Pope has been given. I respond firstly that this power was given by Christ to men, which is certain and is gathered from the usage and practice of the Church. This indeed was fitting, so that the Church, which is constituted of men, might also be governed in a human manner, insofar as possible. **It would not have been consonant with this natural character of the Church, nor indeed with the state of the law of grace, to always expect a sign from heaven discerning and identifying the individual whom God, according to His own disposition, would choose as the legitimate successor of Peter.**
