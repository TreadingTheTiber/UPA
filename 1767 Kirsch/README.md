## Pars I, De Fide Divina, Quaes. IV

[...]

The Scholastic Theologians distinguish two types of election in the selection of a Pontiff: first, one which is conducted here and now by the Sacred College of Cardinals alone, by which the one upon whom two-thirds of the votes are conferred is considered canonically elected as Pontiff; and this they call the primary election. Second, one which is conducted as if by the universal Church, and through this, the one whom the greater part of the faithful acknowledges and accepts without dissension or schism as such, and to whom they render obedience in decisions on faith and morals, is declared legitimately elected as Pontiff: this they call the secondary election.

**N. III. I note, thirdly:** That for one to believe with Divine faith that this particular man is the true Pontiff, it is not sufficient to have the highest moral certainty that this particular man was elevated to the Pontificate by a *primary* election, because falsehood can underlie this, and perhaps often does. The Sacred College does not have an infallible promise of assistance from the Holy Spirit directing them to avoid error in election, since such a College of electors does not represent the whole Church. Therefore, it is required that one have moral certainty about a *secondary* election having taken place, that is, the acceptance by the whole, or the greater part of the Church, of such an individual man as Pontiff. For falsehood cannot underlie this secondary election, which is nothing other than the acceptance of an individual person as Pontiff. For if the true assembly of the faithful and right believers were to err in accepting a visible Head, and were to recognize as Pontiff that individual man who in reality is not the Pontiff, it would certainly err in a most grave matter, namely in discerning the living rule of faith, which error would be equivalent to an error in faith itself. For if the rule could be false, so too could that which is regulated by it; if it would be an intolerable error in the Church for all to believe that some book is canonical which truly is not, it would be much more intolerable to err in discerning the living rule of faith. Wherefore, having established these premises, let it be.

**No. IV. That this or that person, e.g., Clement XIII, gloriously reigning today as Roman Pontiff, who has been accepted by the universal Church as the true and legitimate Pontiff, is credible by Divine faith in the proximate sense.**

This Proposition is demonstrated from the premises established in the previous Question's propositions: in which we asserted that a Theological conclusion is proximately believable by Divine faith when it is deduced either from two explicitly revealed premises, or at least from a universal major premise that is explicitly revealed, and a minor premise evident through physical or highest moral certainty; but such a conclusion is this proposition: *This specific man, e.g., Clement XIII, accepted by the universal Church, is the true Pontiff*; therefore, I prove the minor premise. This proposition: *Every legitimately elected person who is accepted by the Church as Peter's Successor is true and legitimate, just as Peter himself was Pontiff, Vicar of Christ, visible Head, and universal Pastor of the Church*, is explicitly revealed in that statement in Matthew 16: *You are Peter, and upon this Rock, etc.*, to which it is equivalent in meaning. And this minor proposition:
But this individual man Clement XIII is legitimately elected and accepted by the Church, is certain either with the certainty of faith, as some affirm, because the universal acceptance of the Church functions like Divine revelation according to the saying: The voice of the people is the voice of GOD; nor can the Church err in accepting its Head. Or certainly this minor proposition is established through natural evidence and highest moral certainty, since the universal consensus of the Church in accepting this individual man, Clement XIII, as Pontiff is known to all with a certain sensory evidence: therefore the objective conclusion: therefore this individual man, Clement XIII, gloriously reigning, is the true and legitimate Pontiff, Vicar of Christ, visible Head, and universal Pastor of the Church, etc., etc., is an object proximately believable by Divine faith.

[...]

**Problem III.** Unless we were to hold with Divine faith the certainty that this particular individual—for example, Clement XIII—is the true Pontiff, whatever is believed as certain regarding the Judge of controversies in the Church would be entirely ridiculous. For how am I obliged to believe by faith that there exists a Judge of controversies, if I do not hold with the certainty of faith who that Judge is? Of what use would be an assent of faith to the existence of some vague, personally undetermined Judge of controversies? Indeed, if I do not believe this specific individual to be the Judge of controversies, I will not be bound to consult him in matters of doubtful faith, nor to abide by his decisions. This principle applies equally to other objects that we believe by Divine faith, which nevertheless we cannot properly believe unless we simultaneously hold with Divine faith the certainty that this individual person, legitimately elected and accepted by the Church, is the true Pontiff, Successor of Peter, etc. Thus, for example, I will not be bound to believe by Divine faith that the Council of Trent, or any other ecumenical Council, is legitimate, unless I believe that this specific individual, who presided over the Council either personally or through his legates, and confirmed it by his authority, was the true Pontiff; because it is indeed from his authority that true Councils derive their legitimacy.

**Response to the argument** C. M. N. m. *To the first proof* C. M. D. m. This very proposition in precisely these same words is not explicitly revealed C. It is not revealed in other words equivalent in meaning to this proposition N. m. *To confirm, I say*: This universal proposition seems clearly enough revealed in this statement: *You are Peter, and upon this rock, etc.* Although this was pronounced in singular terms, in reality and according to the meaning intended by Christ, it is equivalent to the said universal proposition; otherwise, this particular promise would not have sufficiently provided for the Church if it had been restricted to Peter's person alone, because after Peter's subsequent death, the Church would not have recognized any certain visible Head. **Finally, to that which the objection adds—that it is not to be believed by Divine faith that a legitimately elected Pontiff is the true Pontiff to whom GOD has conferred, as to Peter, the supreme power of governing the Church—because the election depends on the Electors and on the form of election, which was instituted not by the infallible direction of the Holy Spirit but by the judgment of Roman Pontiffs, and therefore can be invalid, *I respond* that the *first* election, as we explained in the preliminary remarks, does indeed depend on these human institutions and can be invalid, but not the *second* election: which is the acceptance by the universal Church of this individual man as Pontiff, because this election depends on the direction of the Holy Spirit, who does not permit the universal Church to err in accepting as Pontiff one who is not truly such before GOD. For just as it pertains to the direction of the Holy Spirit, who according to Christ's promise in *Matthew 28* will be with the Church of right believers until the consummation of the age, not to permit the entire Church to fall into believing some false article as revealed when it has not been revealed: so also, and indeed much more so, it pertains to the assistance of the same Holy Spirit to direct His Bride, the Church, so that she never accepts a false Pontiff as true; for this latter error would be in a certain way more dangerous than the former, because one article of faith does not depend on another, and such an error could easily be corrected by the visible rule—namely, the true Pontiff; but indeed all articles of faith depend on the truth and legitimacy of the Pontiff, who is the living rule of faith: it would therefore be more dangerous for the Church to err in accepting a non-true Pontiff than in admitting an erroneous dogma. Just as, therefore, the Church, because it is the pillar and foundation of truth according to the Apostle in *1 Timothy, ch. 3, v. 25*, cannot err in admitting a false dogma: so neither can it err in accepting an illegitimate Pontiff. Moreover, the public acceptance by the whole Church of this or that individual as its visible Head is a certain testimony from GOD that this is the true Pontiff.**

[...]

**III.** Paul IV, in Bull XIX of the Roman Bullarium, decreed: *"If at any time it should appear that someone, before his elevation to the Pontificate, had deviated from the Catholic faith, or fallen into any heresy, etc., his promotion or elevation, even if made in concord and by the unanimous consent of all Cardinals, shall be null, void, and without force, nor can it be said to have become valid or to become valid through the enthronization of the Roman Pontiff himself, or through his adoration, or through the obedience rendered to him NOTE WELL: by all, or through the passage of any amount of time in the aforementioned matters."* Therefore, it is possible that someone may peacefully occupy the seat of Peter, be venerated as such even by all the faithful, and receive obedience for a long time, and consequently be accepted as Pontiff by the universal Church, while in reality not being such; namely, when he is discovered to have been previously infected with heresy. And so, even supposing the acceptance by the universal Church, it is not a matter of Divine faith that this particular man is the true Pontiff.

[...]

**To the Third Question, I respond:** The entire decree of Paul IV concerns the *first* election of Cardinals customarily conducted in the human manner, but not the *second* election, which derives from the acceptance of the universal Church. The first, which is carried out by Cardinals through the required votes in a human manner, is entirely subject to doubts, errors, and defects, and thus, if an impediment of the Elect is established, it is voidable. To this first election also pertains, as an external ceremony and solemnity, the placement of the Newly-elected upon the Pontifical throne, His so-called adoration, and the oath of obedience rendered by the Cardinal Electors. But the second election is not equally subject to doubts, errors, and defects as the first; indeed, it removes all defects of human law that might have occurred in the first election, and is therefore irrevocable. For the recognition, approval, and acceptance of the same individual person as Pontiff, made by the whole Church or its greater part, is a certain public testimony of GOD that this particular man is the true Pontiff. Hence, more is inferred as a consequence than the Bull of Paul IV establishes.

[...]

**To the Fifth Question:** I concede the antecedent but deny the consequent. For clarification: The disparity is readily apparent: because a Bishop can be simoniacally elected through his own fault; such a one, therefore, although validly ordained, will nevertheless be suspended from conferring all orders, and his institution will be null. Nor is this null election remedied through the acceptance of a particular Church, to which—just as in deciding dogmas of faith—no assistance of the Holy Spirit is promised in accepting a diocesan Bishop. The situation is different regarding the Pontiff: for even if his initial election by two-thirds of the votes could be null and void, **nevertheless, the acceptance of the entire Church, which occurs under the direction of the Holy Spirit, supplies all defects, at least those of human law; because if a defect were to intervene, e.g., if the elected were not male or not baptized, the Holy Spirit would by that very fact direct the universal Church not to accept such a person.** Such acceptance is also an infallible testimony of GOD that the power of feeding Christ's sheep and ruling His Church has been given by GOD to this particular individual.
