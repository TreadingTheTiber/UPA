## Disp. I, Sect IX, Num. XII

For as Fr. Suárez explains in that disputation 10, section 5, number 6, when Christ revealed that Peter was the head of the Church, He equally revealed this generally about all his Successors, and only, says Suárez, a sufficient proposition is lacking regarding this or that person contained under that revelation: but such a proposition is obtained through the universal testimony and approval of the Church. This is clearly explained and confirmed by a similar case: for God never seems to have revealed that the Bishop of Rome, rather than the Bishop of Alexandria, is the Supreme Pontiff, because God never explicitly stated this, but only said it in an indistinct manner when He revealed to Peter his dignity and succession, because such a revelation manifests itself and falls upon those Bishops, or upon their Episcopate, in which one succeeds Peter, after that succession has been sufficiently proposed to the Church through tradition or universal consensus. When, however, it should be understood that a sufficient proposition is given so that it obligates all, it seems to some that this occurs when one who is rightly and truly elected, and therefore the true Pontiff, is proposed: and this indeed is sufficient that we are bound by the precept of obedience and charity to obey such a Pontiff, and that no one can rightfully separate from him without schism; nevertheless, speaking, as we are in fact speaking, of assent through faith, **perhaps the proposition will not be sufficient until it is morally certain that he has been accepted by the whole Church and peacefully possesses his primacy, and thus can obligate all the faithful to believe whatever he has defined: for then it must be most certainly believed that an error cannot occur in the universal Church in a matter so grave as would be a deception in the living rule of faith itself that must be believed, for such an error would be equivalent to an error in faith. For if the rule could be false, so also could that which is ruled; and if it would be an intolerable error in the Church when the whole Church believed some book to be canonical which truly was not, since that is a certain inanimate rule of faith, much more intolerable would it be to err regarding the living rule; indeed, if concerning this an error could ever exist in the universal Church, it would never be true that it has a certain and infallible living rule of faith speaking to it in the name of Christ.**

5.\ Therefore, if anyone, prior to the peaceful acceptance by nations and kingdoms, is morally certain that this man has been canonically elected as Pope, **he is bound to believe that he is the Successor of Peter and possesses supreme authority in the Church of God. Thus, the Most Eminent Cardinals who conduct the election, when they are certain that such a man has been canonically elected, are bound to believe he is the Successor of Peter, without needing to wait to see whether he is peacefully received or not: for God has not bound the validity of the election to the acceptance by Kings and Nations.** The reason is that, by the very fact that a universal proposition is revealed, one can believe by divine faith an individual contained under that proposition, precisely because one is certain that individual is contained under that universal. Thus a Christian who believes by divine faith this universal proposition, *Every infant rightly baptized is in a state of grace*, can believe by divine faith that an infant whom he himself has baptized is in a state of grace, provided he can be certain that he has applied the true matter of baptism under the form instituted by Christ, and with the intention of administering true Baptism. Therefore, since this universal proposition is revealed, *Every man rightly elected as Supreme Pontiff is the Successor of Peter and the true Vicar of Christ*: **whoever is certain that INNOCENT XI was rightly elected, is certain that INNOCENT is formally contained under that universal proposition, and consequently can and must believe that INNOCENT is the Successor of Peter and the true Vicar of Christ.**

6.\ However, since those who were not present at the election cannot have this certainty, except insofar as they know that the Pontiff has been peacefully venerated and accepted, therefore Fr. Suarez says that perhaps this acceptance is required for it to be a matter of faith that this particular man is the Pontiff—that is, for it to be a matter of faith such that all are bound to believe it. And thus, that peaceful acceptance is required by way of application, by the force of which it becomes sufficiently known to the whole Church that this specific man has been rightly elected. **However, this acceptance, which is required by way of application, is not an acceptance that must be sought from the community of all the faithful, or from individual faithful, nor from the community of all Bishops, or from individual Bishops. For it would be most absurd to say that no one can believe that this particular man is the true Pontiff unless one is certain that his election has been accepted by each individual among the faithful, or at least by each individual Bishop. Rather, for those who are in Rome, it is sufficient that they see the elected Pope peacefully venerated by the College of Cardinals, which represents the Church in the matter of electing the Pontiff and makes the election in the name of the Church; and that they see no objection raised that could engender doubt about the validity of the election. For those, however, who are outside Rome, or outside Italy, it is sufficient that certain knowledge of the election and peaceful veneration made in the person of this particular man reaches them, and that they know no reason is adduced which could cause prudent doubt about the legitimacy of the election.**
