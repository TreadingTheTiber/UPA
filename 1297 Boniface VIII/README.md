## Lapsis Abscisus

[...] BONIFACE &c. For a perpetual memorial of the matter. THE STONE CUT OUT from the mountain without hands, rejected by the builders and made into the head of the corner, joining two diverse walls, bringing forth Shepherds from Judea and Magi from the East, reconciling in himself things below with things above and ordering charity in the holy Roman apostolic and catholic Church, **established that same spouse to be one**, as it is written, *My dove is one, my chosen one, my perfect one, she is the only one of her mother, the chosen of her who bore her*, designated by the seamless tunic of the Lord, woven from above throughout the whole. This the soldiers did not divide, but cast lots for it. This have **heretics and schismatics and blasphemers** assailed from her youth. But they have not prevailed against her, protected by divine power and set in order like an army of camps. But not yet has an end been imposed upon heretics, schismatics and blasphemers, such that, like viperous offspring and degenerate sons, they do not strive to disturb her sabbath placed in old age and **to rend her unity**. Among their number are known to be Giacomo (James) of Colonna and Pietro (Peter) his nephew, formerly Cardinals of the said Church, whom—their faults and demerits and those of their followers demanding it—we, moved by reasonable causes and with the counsel of our brother Cardinals, on the 6th day before the Ides of May, in the third year of our Pontificate, perpetually deprived of their Cardinalates and deposed from the same, with various processes and sentences containing threats and penalties held against them, and also against the sons of the late Giovanni (John) of Colonna, brother of the said Giacomo (James) and father of the aforesaid Pietro (Peter), and against all who have descended until now, and do descend, from that same Giovanni (John) through the male and female line.

For indeed, these men Jacobus and Petrus entered the Church in sheep's clothing, but by their works and fruits they showed themselves to be as ravening and burdensome wolves, not sparing the Lord's flock; and given over to a reprobate mind, and blinded in their eyes by malice, so that they did not see nor do they see the light of heaven, descending into the depth of evils, and scorning, they rose up to speak perverse things, and sharpening their tongues like a sword, they broke forth into blasphemous and schismatic words, openly showing that although they went out from us, nevertheless they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would surely have remained with us. These words having been reduced to writing, they caused these writings to be affixed to the doors of various Churches of the city, and to be placed upon the altar of the basilica of the Prince of the Apostles in the city: which writings of theirs clearly indicate their malice long premeditated and preconceived, and manifestly declare that these same Jacobus and Petrus are blasphemers and schismatics, **endeavoring to rend the unity of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church of God**, and to bring the pillar of the living God nearly to the point of collapse, and to submerge the net of the supreme Fisher into the depths of shipwreck amid swelling storms, if, which God forbid, they had the power to do so. For in writings of this kind, which are sent to all who shall inspect the same, of whatever preeminence, dignity, status or condition they may be, whether ecclesiastical or secular, by the aforesaid Jacobus and Petrus under the manner of writing which they were accustomed to use before their deposition, and under the seals which they formerly used; among other things there is contained: That We, **called by divine providence to the summit of the supreme apostolate according to the canons**, though unworthy, and **not only received as Pope by all our brothers, and by them after a prior canonical election, but indeed by the universal Church, consecrated with them assisting according to the approved custom of the Roman Church, and also crowned, are not Pope**; these and other related matters **which are not only blasphemous and schismatic, but insane**, as their writings manifestly indicate.

Even after the aforementioned deposition and deprivation, proceedings and sentences, the Cardinals call themselves [Cardinals], and wear the insignia of the Cardinalate, using rings and red hats, and exercise cardinalatial acts, just as they did before they were deposed by us with the counsel of our brethren, and as they have continued to do until now. Not to mention at present that for nearly three years **they exhibited obedience and reverence to us as Pope**, participating together with us in the reverend sacrament of the Lord's Body and Blood, and ministering to us in the solemnities of Masses and divine offices, just as the Cardinals of the aforementioned Roman Church have customarily ministered to Roman Pontiffs from ancient times; giving their counsel in the provisions and determinations of Churches made by us, and subscribing themselves to privileges granted by us, doing other things with us and receiving [from us] what neither ought to have been done nor received with and from a man who had not had canonical entry [to the papal office]. Nor could they propose that they did the aforesaid things out of fear—they who elected us and nominated [us] to be elected as Pope in the scrutiny, according to the custom of the Cardinals of the aforementioned Church, when there was nothing to be feared from us; and after the election, reception, consecration and coronation, when we had been permitted to remain in their castle, which is called Zagarolo, and which at that time was held by the aforementioned Jacobus, we stayed there confidently with many of our brethren, and they and their men then and there exhibited to us papal reverence and honor, where there was no cause of fear present to them.

We therefore, having had mature deliberation with our said brothers concerning these matters and other things which touch upon or may touch upon a matter of this kind, holding as ratified and approved all processes, all sentences, censures and penalties, and especially the said sentence of deposition and privation of the cardinalates, and the other matters which are contained in our letters drawn up concerning this, by the counsel of these same brothers of ours; we confirm, ratify and approve, and also renew them, and on account of their increased contumacy, schism and blasphemy, by the counsel of the said brothers **we pronounce by sentence that the same Jacobus and Petrus are schismatic and blasphemous, and we bind them with the sentence of excommunication; and that they, persisting in such blasphemy and schism, are to be punished as heretics**; and we make anew, sentence, and pronounce both the said sentence of deposition and privation of the cardinalates, as well as all things which we have done and pronounced against them and others, and we decree that they shall have the force of perpetual firmness.
