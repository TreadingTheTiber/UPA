*Whether it is to be referred to **Faith** immediately, or rather mediately, to believe that this or that person is the Roman Pontiff. Even if you posit that this, and other Facts of this kind, are not to be believed by supernatural Faith, nevertheless this faith is owed to the decrees of Councils, and of the Apostolic See in matters of **Faith** and morals received by the Church. Natural and Moral Evidence in these cases suffices, and **compels us to believe and to obey**: how rash, and worthy of punishment, to call into doubt its established positions.*

For not a few years now, a certain Question has exercised the minds of more recent Theologians, namely whether this proposition pertains to **Faith**: *This or that person is the true Roman Pontiff*. [...] Muratori notes that no one has ever been condemned as a heretic **solely** for denying that some particular man elected as Successor of Peter was the true Roman Pontiff, even amid great schisms. **No other reason, surely, seems to have existed than that this question was believed to pertain to Fact, not to Dogma, and could not be referred immediately to the Faith.**

If someone replies that this censure was withheld only because a man, though rightly elected, had not yet been received by the universal Church, Muratori answers from the Bull of Pope Paul IV. *“If at any time whatsoever it shall appear that anyone before his assumption to the Roman Pontificate deviated from the Catholic Faith, or fell into any heresy, etc., the promotion or assumption concerning him, even if made in concord and with the unanimous consent of all the Cardinals, shall be null, void, and empty, nor can it be said to have become valid, or be able to become valid, through the enthronement of that Roman Pontiff himself, or his adoration, or the obedience rendered to him by all, or the passage of any amount of time in the aforesaid matters.”* From this he concludes that it can happen that one may appear not to be the true Pontiff, although he has occupied Peter's See and has had everyone obedient to him, when he is discovered to have been formerly addicted to heresy. Therefore, **a supernatural assent of Faith cannot be required by which someone is to be believed to be the true Roman Pontiff, even if he has been received by the universal Church**, since Paul IV in no way judges that the Church herself is absolutely immune from all error in this matter of fact.

**But which decrees of the Roman Pontiffs pertaining to Dogma will be certain matters to be believed through Faith?** How will it be unlawful to despise their pronouncements and to call their election into doubt at one's pleasure, how will six hundred other inconveniences be able to be avoided, if we are never commanded to believe some certain man to be the true Successor of Peter? These difficulties led some Scholastic Theologians to demand an immediate assent of **divine Faith** to the proposition *“This or that man is the true Roman Pontiff.”* Yet Muratori judges that, although such matters **are not to be referred immediately to Faith**, nevertheless **they are to be believed as true and certain, and the strength of Dogmas and decrees can stand nonetheless, nor is it permitted to dare anything against legitimate Pontiffs.**

In order that this may be clear, he establishes first as evident that **God once revealed**, besides particular Facts and Dogmas, certain **universal Rules and Judgments** by which the Church and individual men are to be governed in what they must believe and do. These universal rules, revealed by God, **must be applied to particular facts not themselves revealed**, and this application is made by the Roman Pontiffs, by Councils, or by individual men, whenever **natural and moral evidence** moves us. Such evidence is a sufficient cause for us rightly to do or believe something—indeed, it often **compels us so to believe or to act that those who do otherwise are to be punished not only with temporal penalties, but also with eternal ones.** Thus, although the proposition *“This or that man is to be honored by me as a father, as a King”* does not immediately pertain to **Faith**, nevertheless moral evidence makes us so certain of this particular fact that we cannot withdraw the reverence owed without **grave fault and dishonor**, even though no special divine revelation concerning such a fact has been given.

**Thus both to our Bishops, and especially to the Successors of Peter, obedience must be rendered by the Christian flock according to divine commands; and belief must be given to them, and most especially when they are assembled in some legitimate Universal Council, or when the Roman Pontiff is determining some Dogma.** **Divine Faith's assent must be accommodated to this Dogma**, as the ordinances of the most holy Law command. *For even if it has not been revealed to me by God that this man or that has been legitimately elected and is the true Pastor, or that all those assembled in this or that Council are true Pastors: nevertheless, given the preceding moral Evidence, and given that the Church herself and the multitude of the faithful produce faith in us concerning this Evidence by their own assent, I cannot deny that these are the legitimate Pastors of the Catholic Church, and that they propose to me something to be believed in the doctrine of Religion.* God did not will to predict so many particular facts, or to disclose them repeatedly through His revelation. He left to our reason and conscience the use of universals revealed by Him, **which, when Evidence requires, we apply to particular facts.** **Therefore these facts become sufficiently known and certain to our conscience through Evidence, so that there is no excuse for sin if on that account we refuse to obey and believe our Pastors.** Otherwise, if we demanded special divine revelation everywhere before we believed or obeyed, **not only the Church, but the commonwealths of the entire world would be overthrown**, and we would fall into universal skepticism.

[...]

Evidence, however, as I have said, is of one kind Natural, of another Moral. To each there is at times such strength that if we should deny some statement which is established not from divine Revelation but from Evidence alone, we simultaneously deny some statement and dogma revealed by God. After, for example, Natural Evidence has made me certain that this person or that is a man: if I should wish to deny that he himself sinned in Adam, I cannot do so without simultaneously denying a statement pertaining to the faith, that is, that all men sinned in Adam. Therefore I shall prove myself either deranged or impious if I persist in affirming this while denying that. This can be evident in six hundred other examples; both as to what must be done licitly, and as to what must be believed necessarily. **Therefore whoever dares to deny these evident statements, even if not immediately, yet mediately injures the Dogmas of the Faith; and especially that [dogma] which [holds] that Christ governs His Church with special providence, and does not fail it in necessary matters.**
